COMMENT @%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		CGVUpdateScrollbars
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

SYNOPSIS:	Enables/disables the scrollbars as necessary
		for the displayed text.

		NOTE: Important that ContentGenView's dimensions are
		      small enough to fit into one word (each dimension).

CALLED BY:	MSG_CGV_UPDATE_SCROLLBARS
PASS:		*ds:si	= ContentGenViewClass object
		ds:di	= ContentGenViewClass instance data
		es 	= segment of ContentGenViewClass
		ax	= message #
		ss:bp 	= UpdateScrollbarParams
RETURN:		cx  	=  new dimension attrs
DESTROYED:	ax
SIDE EFFECTS:	

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
	First, determine if text would fit in view without scrollbars.
	If text's minimum width > view's width
		enable horizontal scrollbar
	If text's calc'd height for view's width > view height
		enable vertical scrollbar
	After adding scrollbars, get view window's width and check if
		it has changed (by the addition of a vertical scrollbar).
	If view width has changed, check if widest graphic will fit in
		new, smaller width.  If not, enable horizontal scrollbar.
