This file provides a general overview, from high altitude, of the structure of
the Disk module of the kernel.

				 FILE LAYOUT
*******************************************************************************

The Disk module is responsible for tracking the location of disks, most
notably of floppy disks, and making sure the proper disk is in the proper
drive when a file access takes place.

The different files (not including the standard .def files) that make up the
module contain the following sorts of things:

	diskEC.asm		Error-checking code to ensure consistency.

	diskHigh.asm		System-global routines (i.e. the API for the
				module from the application/library/driver
				perspective.)

	diskInit.asm		Initialization routines to create the needed
				sector buffers and create the disk handles for
				any and all fixed disks.

	diskKernelHigh.asm	Kernel-global routines. Contains routines like
				DiskValidate.
