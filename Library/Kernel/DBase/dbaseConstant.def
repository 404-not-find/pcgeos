DESCRIPTION:
    Database constants file.

    What is a group?
	A group is a vmem block which contains information about all items in
	the group, and information about all item-blocks used by the group.

	From the point of view of the code, a group is a vmem handle.

    What is an item?
	An item is a chunk in an item-block. For the purposes of the code, an
	item is an offset into the group-block. At that offset is a structure
	with information about the item, like which item-block it is in, and
	which chunk in the item-block contains the item.

    What is an item-block?
	An item-block is a vmem-block which is formatted as a local memory
	heap. A structure is kept for every item block used by a given group.
	For the purposes of the code, an item-block is an offset into the
	group-block where the information for the item-block resides.

; Most data structures and constants now defined in db.def for use by
; the database-creation macros.

;
; One DBItemInfo structure is kept for every item in the group.
; One DBItemBlockInfo structure is kept for every item-block used by the group.
; A free list is kept for unallocated structures of both types.
; The ItemBlockInfo structures are kept in a list to allow quick access to
;   them.
; No list of ItemInfo structures is kept.
