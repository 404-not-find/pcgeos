ERROR_PARAMS_NOT_AT_OFFSET_ZERO		enum	FatalErrors
; The MSetParameters block is not paragraph aligned; it must be,
; because it is accessed directly off of a segment register.

ERROR_PIXEL_WIDTH_ZERO			enum	FatalErrors
; MSP_pixelWidth is zero, which violates an assumption in the
; line-based calculation algorithm.

ERROR_FIXNUMS_NOT_IN_SAME_SEGMENT	enum	FatalErrors
; The FixNum routines must take pointers to FixNums that all reside
; in the same segment.

; These are the possible return conditions for the routine which calculates
; the points of the MSet.  Call it "...Asm" because there is no C type that
; glue (the linker) can reconcile with an asm "record" type -- the C ByteFlags
; type is just a typedef for "char".
