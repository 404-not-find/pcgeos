; Constants for generating message monikers. The moniker is split into three
; major fields, not all of which are present:
;
; 	[Subject field                   ] [Timestamp]
;	   [Destination                              ]
;
; For outgoing messages:
; 	- the Subject may be preceded by the transport string, if MMF_ALL_VIEW
;	  is passed.
;	- there can be multiple Destination fields (one per line), with each one
;	  preceded by "To: "
; For incoming messages:
; 	- if MMF_ALL_VIEW, the Subject becomes the application name, while the
;	  Destination holds the subject
;	- if !MMF_ALL_VIEW, the Destination doesn't exist
;
; The one constant is the timestamp, which is always an MD_SHORT day followed
; by an HM time, separated by a single space, and is always present in the same
; place.
;
