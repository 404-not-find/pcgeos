LeftOvers	12 + 3 (12+3)
	changes for vm in use - (2) 
	;    Since the object is just being read in, it can't be
	;    selected, have handles drawn, etc. So, nothing in
	;    tempState can be set.  The in use count should also
	;    be zero since there is no temp data to protect
	;
	; Can't clear in use count in reloc because relocate routines
	; use it as offset to reloc or unreloc routine
