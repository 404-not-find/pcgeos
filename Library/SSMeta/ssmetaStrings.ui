 *  The max length this string can be without biffing CIH_formatCount
 *  when it's copied to the scrap header is 32 chars.  The spanish
 *  translation of this string is 33 chars, which of course causes some
 *  pretty serious problems.
 *
 *  Since nobody ever seems to use the name of the scrap for anything
 *  meaningful, I'm adding a "localize not" directive.  If your project
 *  actually requires that this string be localizable for some strange
 *  reason, do NOT remove the localization statement.  Instead, change
 *  it to explain that the max length is 32 letters (including embedded
 *  accents and cruft like that).  -stevey 4/10/96
