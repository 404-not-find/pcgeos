SYNOPSIS:	Driver has closed a link

CALLED BY:	SocketLinkStrategy
PASS:		ax	= link handle

RETURN:		nothing
DESTROYED:	nothing
SIDE EFFECTS:	

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
	If the link is already being closed by this side, wait until our
	close request completes.

	The driver will not reuse the connection handle, since it knows this
	call is in progress.  Hence we don't need to worry about checking
	the link id, like we do in SocketCloseLink.

COMMENT @%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

SYNOPSIS:	Handle an exception for a datagram socket

CALLED BY:	SocketDataStrategy
PASS:		al	= SocketDrException
		bx	= local port number
		dx	= domain handle
RETURN:		nothing
DESTROYED:	nothing
SIDE EFFECTS:	

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
	This can't be implemented until the domain handle is added
	as a parameter.  Once that happens, we can locate the PortInfo,
	find the datagram receiver, and fill in DSI_exception.

	At this time, there is no way for the user to read DSI_exception.
	Whomever implements this can worry about that as well.
