Basically, things were getting very convoluted when trying to debug.
We had linked the database, list and GrObj behavior too closely. For
instance, routines that dealt with the internal lists changing (those
in the FlatFile instance data) assumed that corresponding changes 
should also be made in the layout GrObjects, when that behavior may
not have been what was desired by all calling routines.

Now, the behavior is broken up, so that the calling routine has to 
send separate messages for each type of behavior:
	Creating/modifying a field
	Changing the internal layout/not_in_layout lists
	Changing the GrObj

Also, many method handlers/routines were doing ifs and case statements,
when it was really cleaner to have two (or more) different routines
doing the work.

And while we were at it, we made some name changes for clarity.

Name Changes:

	WHOLE_DATABASE -> DATABASE_NAME_LIST
	LAYOUT_LIST -> LAYOUT_NAME_LIST
	DATABASE_LIST -> NOT_IN_LAYOUT_NAME_LIST

	FFI_sortedColumns -> FFI_databaseNameList
	FFI_fieldsInCurrentLayout -> FFI_layoutNameList
	FFI_fieldsInDatabase -> FFI_notInLayoutNameList

	FFI_numFieldsInCurrentLayout -> FFI_numInLayoutNameList
	FFI_numFieldsInDatabaseList -> FFI_numInNotInLayoutNameList

	...AND_SEND_BACK_MSGS -> ...WITH_RESPONSE

	DeleteFieldListElement -> DeleteFieldFromList

Messages broken up:
	MSG_FFD_STORE_FIELD_INFO  -> MSG_FFD_CREATE_NEW_FIELD,
				     MSG_FFD_CHANGE_FIELD_ATTRIBUTES

New messages:
	MSG_FFD_ADD_NAME_TO_LAYOUT_LIST
	MSG_FFD_ADD_NAME_TO_NOT_IN_LAYOUT_LIST

	MSG_FFD_DELETE_NAME_FROM_LIST
	MSG_FFD_CHANGE_NAME_IN_LAYOUT_LIST
