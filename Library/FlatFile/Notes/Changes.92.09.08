* Biggest changes involved the following:
  Nuked the old ffRecordLayoutRectClass, since the record layout boundary
  object has been made obsolete by Jeremy's new record size/page size
  stuff. The page layout boundary (repeat box) still tiles the record
  layout boundary the way it did before.

* Record size and layout size are now stored appropriately, and display
  is updated when you switch layouts. Added the following messages to
  flatfile:
  MSG_FFD_SET_SINGLE_RECORD_BOUNDS
  MSG_FFD_GET_SINGLE_RECORD_BOUNDS
  MSG_FFD_SET_MULTI_RECORD_BOUNDS
  MSG_FFD_GET_MULTI_RECORD_BOUNDS

* Nuked old Mode types because they encompassed layout type as well.
  Now, instead of referring to multi-record in data entry mode as
  MT_DATA_ENTRY_MULTI_RECORD, GeoFilers should refer to mode type = 
  MT_DATA_ENTRY and layout type = LT_MULTI_RECORD.

* Displays multi-record in Data Entry mode.

* Deals with the first record layout not starting at (0,0)

* Gives the user different options on ordering: Left->Right and Top->Bottom,
  or Top->Bottom and Left->Right

* Note: Does NOT yet deal with record movement (i.e. selecting different
  record, scrolling etc.) in multi-record data entry mode.

* Removed Options menu because after all the cutbacks the only thing left
  was the Tool Manager, which Doug says won't be included. Just saving him
  the trouble of nuking it :)

* Fixed Doug's bug where it crashed after deleting a record.

* Improved UI for mode types and layout type selection.

* geos.h: changed sword from "short" to "signed short" to avoid
  type compatibility problems (thanks JohnM :)

* grobj.goh: added prototypes for MSG_GO_GET_CENTER and MSG_GB_GET_BOUNDS.

Note that there is still a lot of work to be done for multi-record data
entry to be working properly, but I had to install now so Jeremy could 
access some of the above changes.

Mkmf'd flatfile, updated its protocol, remade flatfile and geofile 
(non-ec only) and downloaded.
