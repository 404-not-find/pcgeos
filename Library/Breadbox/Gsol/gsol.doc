*** Description of calls in the GSOL library:


- Creating GSOL-marked GStrings:

word _pascal GSOLMarkGStringStart(
  GStateHandle gs, GeodeToken *token, word PN_major, word PN_minor);

should be the first command to be executed on a newly created GString. This
includes a standard GSOL comment ("owner tag") into the string, containing the
passed token and protocol number.

If desired, an application specific comment describing the contents of the
GString may be inserted after this call by using the GrComment() call. The
data block passed to this comment can be retrieved automatically later when
scanning the GString with GSOLCheckGString().


word _pascal GSOLMarkGStringEnd(
  GStateHandle gs, GeodeToken *token, word PN_major, word PN_minor);

should be called at the end of the GString, before invoking GrEndGString().
This includes an "end" tag into the GString, thus allowing nested GStrings
containing multiple objects by different creators.


- Testing received GStrings for GSOL information

word _pascal GSOLCheckGString(
  GStateHandle gs, GeodeToken *token, ProtocolNumber *prot,
  void *retbuf, word bufsize);

tests a given GString for presence of GSOL tags of a specific application. The
routine must be passed the token of the application to look for. If a GString
"tagged" for this application is found, the protocol number of the first
matching owner tag is returned. If a return buffer is specified, the data
block of any GrComment immediately following the owner tag is copied into that
buffer if its size is less than or equal to bufsize.

*Note:* In the current version, checking for multiple/nested GSOL objects in a
single GString is not implemented.


word _pascal GSOLIdentifyGString(
  GStateHandle gs, GeodeToken *token, ProtocolNumber *prot);

tests a given GString for presence of any GSOL tags: If a tagged GString is
passed, the token and protocol number of the first owner tag is returned.

*Note:* In the current version, checking for multiple/nested GSOL objects in a
single GString is not implemented.


*** Pseudocode examples:

- Creating a GString:

    gstate = GrCreateGString(...);
    GSOLMarkGStringStart(gstate,&token,PROTO_MAJOR,PROTO_MINOR);

    /* draw to gstring */

    GSOLMarkGStringEnd(gstate,&token,PROTO_MAJOR,PROTO_MINOR);
    GrEndGString(gstate);


- Checking a GString for data of a specific application:

    if( GSOLCheckGString(gs,&token,&prot,&appdata,sizeof(appdata))==0 )
    {                                 /* see if GString contains GSOL info */
      if( prot.PN_major==PROTO_MAJOR && prot.PN_minor==PROTO_MINOR )
      {                               /* yes: our version? */
          /* yes: use data passed in appdata */
      }
      else
      {
          /* not compatible: notify user or convert data from older version */
      }
    }


- Checking a GString for data of any application:

    gs = GrLoadGString(...);
    if( GSOLIdentifyGString(gs,&token,&prot)==0 )
    {
        /* process returned token and protocol */
    }
