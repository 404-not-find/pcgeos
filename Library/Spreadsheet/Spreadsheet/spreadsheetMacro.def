COMMENT @%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		RoundToByte
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

SYNOPSIS:	Round a value to the next byte multiple

PASS:		width - value to round

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
	The idea behind rounding a value to a byte multiple is used for
	column widths, as it makes horizontal scrolling about 33% faster.
	So column widths are forced to byte mutiples because it good.
