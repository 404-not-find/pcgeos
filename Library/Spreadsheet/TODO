==============================================================================

(1) separate the row/column and attribute notification generation
(2) cache last sent attribute notification so moving w/o a selection
    doesn't generate lots of handles
(3) speed up number formatting!!
(4) for GeoFile, add flag to insert/delete to skip check for updating
    dependencies (since there are none in the data area for it)
(5) Change IRR function to use a better interpolation technique.  Currently
    it uses a binary search, which converges rather slowly sometimes.
    Much better would be a technique which uses how far the last guess
    was off from what we wanted to make the next guess.
