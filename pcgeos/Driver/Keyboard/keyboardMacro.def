; Here are a bunch of macros that are used for the E3G scanning keyboard.
; They are primarily here since Responder differs from other users of the
; E3G keyboard scan in that Responder calls a library to do all of their
; I/O.  I used these macros so that we didn't have this lovely conditional
; code all over the place in the _E3G_KBD_SCAN code.  They are pretty
; straightforward.
