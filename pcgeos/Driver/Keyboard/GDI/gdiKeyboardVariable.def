; The purpose of this list is to keep track of keys that have been pressed.
; This allows us to:
;	1) Know if a key is repeated.
;	2) Implement the concept of STATE-capturing on the press
;	   of any key (state of SHIFT, etc. on press of key is
;	   preserved throughout repeat & release, even if SHIFT,
;	   etc. keys change state during this time period.)
;	3) Assures a release for every initial press. (Even if
;	   SHIFT changes before release)
;	4) Prevents repeated non-ALT modified keys being sent if:
;	    ALT-press
;	    key-press
;	    ALT-release
;	    delay till auto-repeat..
;	5) Know if a repeated key was modified by a previous accent character.
;
; when a key is pressed, it's scan code & data portion of the event
; created are stored here.  The element is removed on receiving a release
; of the key, at which time the same data is passed as part of the event.
; If a key is repeated by the keyboard, it will be found here, & the REPEAT
; flag will be sent, & that data sent as the event.
