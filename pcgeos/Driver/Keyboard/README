 *    How to create a new foreign keyboard driver, step by step.
 *
 * Background:
 *    A keyboard driver can be creating using KMEdit, but it should be moved
 *    under RCS control to ensure that data is not lost. Below is a series
 *    of steps that can be followed by anyone wishing to install a new
 *    keyboard driver into 1.2X & the trunk (referred to here as 2.0).
 *
 * People to see if this doesn't work:

Creating the directories
========================
(0) Create the necessary directories that you will use later.  If there are
    multiple drivers of this class, such as a non-extended and extended
    driver for a country, there will be two levels of directories, one for
    the country, and one below it for each variation.  For example, the
    Spanish keyboard drivers are in:
	/staff/pcgeos/Driver/Keyboard/Spanish/Extended
	/staff/pcgeos/Driver/Keyboard/Spanish/NonExtended
    If, however, there is just a single variation, there will be just a
    single directory.  For example, the Dvorak keyboard driver is in:
	/staff/pcgeos/Driver/Keyboard/Dvorak.

    The necessary directories are:
     (a) source directories:
	/staff/pcgeos/Driver/Keyboard/<country>/<type>
	/staff/pcgeos/Release12X/Driver/Keyboard/<country>/<type>
     (b) RCS directory:
	/staff/pcgeos/Driver/Keyboard/<country>/<type>/RCS
     (c) object directories:
	/staff/pcgeos/Installed/Driver/Keyboard/<country>/<type>
	/staff/pcgeos/Release12X/Installed/Driver/Keyboard/<country>/<type>
     (d) your directory:
	/staff/pcgeos/<login>/Driver/Keyboard/<country>/<type>
     (e) your Installed directory:
	/staff/pcgeos/<login>/Installed

Creating the keyboard map
=========================
(1) Use KMEdit, and create the new keyboard driver. Test it thoroughly.
    It will appear in Preferences as "U.S. Keyboard".

(2) Attach 1.2 to swat. Use KMEdit to open your new keyboard driver.

(3) Stop swat and switch to kmedit

(4) Load pkmap.tcl (you may need font.tcl for a subroutine or two)

(5) Type "pkmap keyMap <filename>". <filename> should be a complete
    path description to your directory, and the file should be in
    the format:
		kmap[COUNTRY][EXT].def.

	Example: German Extended    - kmapGermanExt.def
		 French NonExtended - kmapFrench.def

Creating the keyboard driver, using templates
=============================================
(6) Go copy the following files from any foreign keyboard driver, like
    Release12X/Dutch/Extended, to your directory:
		keyboard.asm
		local.mk
		kbde_be.gp
NOTE: Be sure to clean out the RCS Id fields (ie. since these are going
    to be new files, the fields should be empty: \$\I\d\$)
    (the backslashes are there to keep RCS from mucking with *this* string;
    in the real file they won't be there)
NOTE: The files you copy will be write-protected since they represent
    source files under RCS.  You'll need to chmod the copies to make them
    writable, e.g.:
	chmod +w keyboard.asm

(7) Modify the kmap*.def file  by adding a standard file header to it.
    (including an RCS Id)

(8) Modify the local.mk with the actual name of the geode. Look at the
    DOS file name of your current keyboard driver if this is unclear.
    KMEdit will create the DOS name appropriately of the form:
	kbd{e,n}_{us,sv,sf,sg,...}.geo

	keyboard type:
	--------------
	e - extended keyboard
	n - non-extended keyboard

	country (matches DOS "keyb" command argument):
	----------------------------------------------
	be - Belgium
	cf - Canadian-French
	df - Denmark
	fr - France
	gr - Germany
	it - Italy
	la - Latin America
	nl - Netherlands
	no - Norway
	po - Portugal
	sf - Swiss-French
	sg - Swiss-German
	sp - Spain
	su - Finland
	sv - Sweden
	uk - United Kingdom
	us - United States

    Not every keyboard follows this exactly (eg. the Dutch keyboard is
    actually the Belgian keyboard, and the French have a separate PS/1
    keyboard, etc.), but you get the general idea.  SETUP.EXE uses this
    name to determine which keyboard driver to set initially when the
    user installs, and is determined from the DOS "keyb" command.   If
    DOS doesn't have a different keyboard set, then the U.S. keyboard
    is used.

(8a) If this is a single variation keyboard driver, then you will also
     need to change the .PATH lines in the local.mk file 
     from "../../" to just "../"

(9) Modify the keyboard.asm file with the name of the driver (eg.
    "French Extended Keyboard Driver")

(9a) If this is a single variation keyboard driver, then you will also
     need to change the include lines in the keyboard.asm file
     from "../../" to just "../"

(10) Change kbde_be.gp to the geode name you found in step 8. Modify
     the header, and the name & longname keyword strings.

(11) Type mkmf to create the Makefile. Ensure things make properly, by
     doing a pmake in your directory.

(12) Install the keyboard driver into Release12X & the trunk. This
     works if the development tree you're working in has a BRANCH file
     with Release12X inside.  Type:
	"ginstall `fui`"
     to install all the files (4) you've created/copied.  For each of
     the files, RCS will prompt you for a file description. Make the file
     descriptions accurate and descriptive, or we'll burn your house down.

Creating the .rev file
======================
(13) Go to /staff/pcgeos/Driver/Keyboard/<whatever>.

(14) Type "grev new <filename>", where <filename> is the completely
     lower-cased name of the directory your are in (eg. French/Extended ->
     extended.rev)

(15) Type "grev newrev <filename> 1.2" to get to the Release12X branch.

(16) Type "grev newbranch <filename> Release12X 100" to create the
     Release12X branch.

(17) Now the job is to get to the current release number in the
     branch. At the time of this writing, it was 1.2.5.x. So, type
	"grev -BRelease12X nc <filename>"
     to up the release number upped on the V1.2X branch. You'll need as
     to type this once for each number or use UNIX magic.You're almost done,
     so hang in there.

Making 1.2
==========
(18) Now go to /staff/pcgeos/Release12X/Driver/Keyboard/<whatever>.
     Type "getbranch". Four files and a symbolic link should magically
     appear. If they don't, stop. Talk to someone like Don or Adam.

(19) Now type "mkmf" to create the Makefile & dependencies.

(20a) Go to /staff/pcgeos/Release12X/Installed/Driver/Keyboard/<whatever>:
	"cd /staff/pcgeos/Release12X/Installed/Driver/Keyboard/<whatever>"

(20b) Link to the Makefile in the 1.2X source tree
	"ln -s /staff/pcgeos/Release12X/Driver/Keyboard/<whatever>/Makefile"

(20c) Make the 1.2X version of the keyboard driver:
	"pmake full"

(21a) Go to your own Installed directory:
	"cd /staff/pcgeos/<login>/Installed"

(21b) Lock the 12X send & Makefile:
	"lock send"
	"lock Makefile"

(21c) Add the new keyboard driver.  If you're not familiar with the format
     of a Makefile, this can be a tricky step.  Seek professional help.

(21d) Install these files:
	"ginstall -M send"
	"ginstall -M Makefile"

(21e) Send mail to installs to let people know what you've done:
	"mail installs"

Fixing up 2.0
=============
(22) Time to fix up 2.0. The only difference* at this writing between
     1.2X & 2.0 was the fact that the Input library had been folded in to
     the Kernel. Lock the 2.0 .gp file, and remove the "library im" line.
     Install the file.

(22a) Another difference is in the keyboard maps.  The entry for the
      space bar (scancode 0x39) has been changed from:
	    KEY_NONALPHA or KD_EXTENDED or KD_ACCENTABLE,
	    <C_BSW C_SPACE>,
	    <C_BSW C_SPACE>,
	    0x5 
      to:
	    KEY_SOLO or KD_EXTENDED or KD_ACCENTABLE,
	    <C_BSW C_SPACE>,
	    <C_BSW C_BSW>,
	    0x5 


(23) Type "mkmf" in /staff/pcgeos/Driver/Keyboard/<whatever> to create
      the Makefile & dependencies.

(24a) Go to the Installed directory:
	"cd /staff/pcgeos/Installed/Driver/Keyboard/<whatever>"

(24b) Link to the Makefile you just created:
	"ln -s /staff/pcgeos/Driver/Keyboard/<whatever>/Makefile"

(24c) Make the 2.0 keyboard driver:
	"pmake full"

(25a) Go to your own Installed directory:
	"cd /staff/pcgeos/<login>/Installed"

(25b) NOTE: you *must* delete your branch file at this point, or do this
      in a V2.0 development tree, or else know what you're doing.

(25c) Lock the V2.0 send & Makefile:
	"lock send"
	"lock Makefile"

(25d) Add the new keyboard driver.  If you're not familiar with the format
     of a Makefile, this can be a tricky step.  Seek professional help.

(25e) Install these files:
	"ginstall -M send"
	"ginstall -M Makefile"

(26f) Send mail to installs to let people know what you've done:
	"mail installs"

(26) You're done!  Go drink a beer or two or five...


-----------------
* Two other differences between the 1.X and 2.X keyboard driver have no effect
on your making a driver, but they are worth of note. The function
DR_KBD_SET_MAP has been deleted (as being untenable of implementation) and the
function DR_KBD_CHANGE_OUTPUT has been added. This last is implemented in
keyboardProcess.asm and consists of an xchg and a return. Since
keyboardProcess.asm is one of the files that's common to all the drivers, it
matters not.
