This document is a quick description of the Text Only mode printing system.
(Please excuse the poor writing)

The basic reason for the very existence of Text Only Mode is that the way that
GEOS prints all the nice fonts, and graphics, is to use a bit image graphics
mode. This is essentially like printing out a bitmap of the entire page. One
dot printed on the page corresponds to one bit set in the bitmap. This results
in a huge amount of data (easily 1Meg for a monochrome printer) that takes a
long time to generate and send out the printer port. Text Only mode is intended
as a draft replacement for this time comsuming process. The Text Only Mode uses
the fonts that are already in the printer to print out GEOS documents. Since
the font is already in the printer, only a ASCII char needs to be sent to get
1 character printed on the paper. This method means that it only takes about
2-3k of data to define a page. Obviously this takes less time to transmit to
the printer, and so the printout takes less time. So, the Text Only Mode is not
WYSIWYG, and takes much less time.

Advantages-
	Takes much less time
Disadvantages-
	not WYSIWYG
	portrait text only

Spooler:
	Takes the Graphics String, and picks out all the portrait text opcodes.
These are sorted into style runs based on their position in Y and then X. The
resulting array is passed a style run at a time to the print driver, which
positions it on the page, and sets all the appropriate style, font, color
information in the printer before sending the actual text to print.

DotMatrix Drivers:
	Take the style runs from the spooler, and set the font, style color
information in the printer. Since none of the printer resident fonts have a
metrically equivalent GEOS font (except the courier fixed pitch font), the
driver calculates the width of the style run, and sets a fixed pitch font in
the printer that is equal to or next narrower than the desired GEOS font.
This means that the user cannot get a proportional font to print using the Text
Only mode.

PCL:
	On newer printers, GEOS fonts are built out and dowloaded as small
bitmaps of just the characters. Then the font matches exactly the GEOS screen
versions. The style runs are positioned and the newly downloaded fonts are
selected to print a WYSIWYG version of just the portrait font info.
	Old PCL printers cannot dowload font info, so the font selection  is
left up to the LaserJet's font selection function. This means that proportional
fonts can be selected, and the printout will more closely match the screen than
the output from a dotmatrix printer.

CaPSL:
	CaPSL (Canon LBP) works like the old LaserJets, but is better, because
the CaPSL printers have scalable fonts, and so you can accurately specify the
pointsize.
