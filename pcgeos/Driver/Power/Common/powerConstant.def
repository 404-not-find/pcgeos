; The bit indicating that a serial COM port is passively allocated.  When this
; bit is set in a SerialPortNum, the following behavior is expected from a
; power driver:
;
;	If a passive serial port is being powered up, its port should be 
;	powered enough to receive data only, if possible (since a passive
;	port is read-only).  If there's no way to power up the port for just
;	receiving data, then power it up fully.
;
;	If there is a shutdown request while a passive port is in use, power
;	down the port and allow the shutdown.  On restart, the port should be
;	configured as it was before (though the serial driver will reset the
;	hardware just in case).
