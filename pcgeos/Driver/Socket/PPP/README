---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Features not included in GEOS version of PPP, ported from Morningstar:

Data Compression
	Data compression was omitted from our port due to size
	concerns.  Morningstar engineers game me size estimates in 
	the 100K range, due in large part to the compression tables.  
	I am not familiar with the different data compression protocols 
	and have taken their estimates at face value.
 
CCP (Compression Control Protocol)
	This is the protocol used by PPP to negotiate which data 
	compression protocol the link will use.  The code for 
	this is already included in GEOS PPP, but is currently 
	commented out.  To enable the code, simply define USE_CCP 
	in the local.mk file.

Microsoft CHAP Extensions
	Microsoft CHAP extensions uses a non-standard encryption 
	algorithm to allow for NT passwords.  The NT PPP server 
	does not support the standard, MD5, encryption, forcing
	GEOS PPP to use PAP authentication with it.  PAP allows
	passwords to be transmitted as clear text, making it less
	secure than CHAP.  

	To support this feature we would only need to implement 
	the client side of MS_CHAP.  I have already analyzed the 
	efforts required to make this change.  Work will take at 
	least 2 weeks and increases size of PPP by at least 2K.

	Eventually, NT may support MD5 (the standard), allowing
	CHAP to be used when connecting to NT even if we do
	not implement the MS CHAP extensions.

Login Scripts
	Morningstar's PPP includes code to enable logging in to 
	remote servers using a login script.  This feature was
	also left out of the port because the parsing code takes
	a lot of memory.  Eventually, either this can be included
	in our PPP, or the user can use a terminal app to login,
	and we can add API for opening the link over a physical 
	connection which has already been established.

Tunneling
	This was left out of our port as well.  Morningstar's PPP
	allows PPP to be run over telnet, and other tunnels.  I'm
	not too familiar with how this works or what the benefits
	of having this feature would be.

LCP Extended Options
	Not supported.  Options include: FCS Alternatives, 
	self-descibing padding, callback, compound frames,
	time remaining, identification.  For details, see
	the RFC on LCP Extensions.

Multiple simultaneous PPP connections
	Not supported.  Would require significant work to 
	implement this, including changes to the modem driver
	to allow it to support multiple ports being in use
	at the same time.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Weaknesses:

Dynamic port selection for PPP connection
	The serial port used by PPP is set in the INI file and
	cannot be changed dynamically.  It would be nice if PPP
	could be told the port to use on a per connection basis.
	Analysis of this work has been completed.  Involves 
	changes to the access point library as well.

Minor change to PPP authentication
	Passwords are currently stored in the ini file under the
	PPP category with the username as the key.  Should change
	passwords to be stored under a separate category (ppp secrets?)
	to prevent breakin by someone using a username that is identical
	to a key used by PPP.


===========================================================================
Morningstar naming conventions have been preserved during the port.
This does not comply with GEOS naming conventions, but makes it
considerably easier to maintain the code when comparison with the
original is required.
