Question:	Why are these files sitting in Clr2 under Vidmem when they are
		not included in Vidmem?

Answer(Joon):	I thought about installing all of these files into the Simp2Bit
		directory, but then decided that we might someday add Clr2 to
		Vidmem.  I still have some additional Vidmem files locked out
		with some changes in case we do decide to add Clr2 to Vidmem.

		The other reason is that I'm sure we'll have at least one more
		2-bit video driver which could reuse at least some of this
		code.  And having the 2-bit code here makes more sense
		(at least to me).

		Some warnings about using this code:

		1. I used 386 instructions in some places in the code
		   (bitblt, getbits), so if you need this on something
		   < 386, then you'll have to rewrite a few functions.
			   
		2. This code was written to run on an E3G chip which
		   has video memory laid out in a weird way.  The left
		   most pixel is in the lowest bits.  And the memory
		   is laid out in big-endian words.  Meaning the first
		   pixel of a scanline is in the low 2 bits of the *2nd*
		   byte.  If you need a 2-bit driver for something
		   other than an E3G, you'll have to go back and fix
		   up some color and mask tables and also if out a lot
		   of xchg instructions I added (or you might have to
		   add some).  I should have taken care of this while
		   I was writing it, but got lazy.  Sorry.  But then I
		   think I will be the one to write the next 2-bit driver,
		   so I'm the one who's going to suffer for it.
