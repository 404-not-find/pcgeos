  * Fix storing of additional phone type names.
	The storing of phone type names right now places them one-after-
	another into a DBItem chunk.  Old names are not removed, as they
	should be.  The code was installed sothat Pizza/J could proceed.

	In the file Dial/dialUtils.asm, about lines 170-200 the code
	should be changed.  An algorithum folllows:

	find target phoen type index to replace.
	foreach pointer to a name -> d
	    suchthat target.disp < d, do
		strcpy( d-target.size, d, d.length )
		d -= target.size
	endfor
	strcpy( target.disp, newPhoneType );
	return( ++totalPhoneNames ).

	Brian Witt (witt@fusion) will most likely do the change.
	If not, Gene Anderson (gene@fusion) will have paperwork describing
	the work that needs to be done.
