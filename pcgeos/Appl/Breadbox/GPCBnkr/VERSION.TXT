2/19/99

 - version 0.5.0.1  to GPC for build 9
Known bugs as of 2/19/99...
 - Help, resize, and max buttons do not appear on report window title bar.  Appears to be because I've supressed the sys menu (I want to do some closing stuff).  This problem only appeared when help context ATTR was moved from reply bar to title bar.  Prior to moving the help to the title bar, the resize and max buttons were there.
 - #0283 - large numbers exceed space allotted.  I'm not sure what we can do about it other than tell the user to zoom out in the View menu.
 - Grey box to the left of Tax check box. I tried Brian's suggested fix to no avail...  I'll work up a small test applet and send it to him for his perusal.

 - Can't get the tiny (15 x 15) icon to show up on the title bar.
 - Copy button in Report Window doesn't grey when nothing is selected.  This is because the Edit controller was changed in build 5 (the require and prohibit UI features) so I bypassed the edit menu completely for the Copy and Select All big buttons.

1/20/99
 - Version 0.2.0.3 sent to GPC for build 5
