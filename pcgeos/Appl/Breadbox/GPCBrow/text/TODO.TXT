WebMagick todo
--------------

Bugs:

 - Crash: N2WCTITL.HTM with images on

 - Crash: www.celestatools.com ("smart forms", when called from www.ccc.fi),
   not reproducible

 - GState/Window leak (possibly related to graphics import?)
   07/01/98 -- Does not appear to be there.

 - Geoworks web page: bad link anchor in left navigation bar

 - www.nordrhein.net -> links -> Star Trek -> news causes bad resolution of
   relative URL (uses context of topmost frame rather than the frame from
   which the link originated).

 - Width of page always seems to be slightly bigger than necessary

Navigation:

 - store entry for HTTP URL redirection in cache

 - reload: don't go back to top of page

 - store current position within page on back stack

 - additional "<<", ">>" (fast back/forward) function to skip from one
   top-level change to another

 - convert local file URLs of directories into directory listings

 - ignore ".." in relative URLs if already at root level

 - pseudo frames (frames simulated by links or menu entries, with only one
   frame being shown at a time)

 - add possibility for temporary "virtual" renaming of URLs to allow access
   to reorganized or renamed trees of (local) HTML files.

   completed:
 X add hotlist/bookmarks (possibly with Netscape-compatible BOOKMARK.HTM)
 X store anchor links within a page on "back"/"forward" stack
 X extend forward/back stack to any frame changes

Display/Printing:

 - make view transparent on non-transparent backgrounds to reduce flicker

 X backgrounds are not always redrawn after a change of zoom factor.

 - load local/cached graphics already while parsing

 X fixed width for top level text object (no rewrapping when zoom factor
   is changed), optionally reflow to page width specified in page size control
   rather than to window with at 100%.

 X add a horizontal scroll bar when graphics are to wide for WM window

 - pagination for multi-page documents doesn't seem to work properly:
   "printing feature seems to have problems!  It cut off the tops and bottoms
   from each page, leaving a large title only two-thirds printed and chopping
   of the middle of several paragraphs that happened to span page breaks.  I
   am using a DeskJet 850c printer (and suspect the same would not be true of
   a dot matrix printer using fanfold paper)." [Tyson Schoeber]

 - number of copies cannot be changed in print dialog


Additional HTML support:

 X <META BASE=...>

 X forms

 X tables

 X client side image maps

 - HR attribute: WIDTH

 - additional named colors (full Netscape color list)

 - equations/maths (supported standard may have yet to be decided on)

 - CDF channels


Modify HTML support:

 - comment "<!--...>" and "<!--...--!>" is not closed properly, but it works
   in Netscape...


HTML Impex filter:

 - derived filter: ISO Latin/Windows ANSI - Import/export for text files

 - option to import entire HTML trees to Bookreader help file source codes
   (with links). It has to be observed that Bookreader link names may only be
   20 characters long - for this reason, URLs should be converted to short
   names internally. In addtion, title lines have to be added which have the
   link destination assigned as a context.


HTML export:

 - Add support HTML formatting and structure to export filter


Graphics import:

 - Reintroduce old "WM native" import library API.

 - Automatically load list of impex filters.

 - Support filters with multiple formats. Associations of mime types and
   filters should be stored in the INI file:

   Mime Types = {
     <mime type> = <filter name>,<name of format in impex filter>
   }

 - Placeholders for graphics whose size is already known during parsing


Other:

 - File cannot be viewed while it is open in tedit.geo.

 - Invoking the editor more than once always creates multiple copies instead
   of using the current launch model.

 - Select and call editor via token.

 - Editor should also be callable through its long name.

 - Pass file name to editor via GenDocument IACP.

 - Use creator tags for calling viewers when downloading Geos files.

 - Use associations between extensions and applications from fileManager INI
   entry for calling viewer applications.

 - optionally: automatically refresh local file URLs when the file is
   changed.

 - abbreviate file basename to 8 characters on "FILE:" URLs


Transport drivers:

 - Browsing directly from a Netscape cache (supporting both OS/2 and Windows
   cache format)

 ? add support for password protection to driver API

 - add support for "If-modified-sice" to driver API

 - add support for passing multiple URLs to the URL driver in one request
   to allow multithreaded fetching inside the driver.


Internal:

 X size limit for Object Cache with removal of old entries

 - store timestamps with cache entries

 - implement navigation commands (forward, back, home etc.) as controller

 - use local name pool for transfer items

 - extend name pool routines
     - support for names (especially URLs) with more than 256 characters
     - compressed storage

 - free text storage as soon as a frame is deinitialized; deactivate top
   frame when closing document

 - optimize frame set geometry set-up

 - optimize establishing of a frame set which already exists partially (reload
   flag may have to be propagated)

 X run graphics import/HTML formatting on seperate thread


Known problems:

 - transparent bitmaps are not displayed correctly in 16 colors (system bug!)

 - German OmniGo: "Vergr”áern", "Verkleinern" menu entries in View controller
   have been mixed up.

 ? Storing of current point size seems to fail sometimes.
