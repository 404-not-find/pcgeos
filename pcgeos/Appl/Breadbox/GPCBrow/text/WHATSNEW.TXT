=== GPCBrow (also includes html4par library, graphics import and URL drivers)

03/16/99 version (Marcus):

  - If an anchor has both a NAME and a HREF attribute, it is now properly
    underlined. [GPC bugs #300, #301]

  - Misleading error message ("...cannot be viewed using this program.") when
    user hits Discard in the "Save Web File" dialog removed. The browser now
    simply stays on the page from where the link originated. [GPC bug #344]

  - Implemented Brian's fix for uninitialized Favorites dialog.

  - Fixed bug that would cause crashes with URL drivers when version was
    compiled without logging.

  - Removed "Show/Hide Toolbar" commands (compile option).

  - Moved and renamed "Reset Browser Memory" command (now in File menu).

  - Removed obsolete ADD_FAVORITE code in URLDocument class.

  - Fixed a lock leak in NameAssocFindAssociation() if no entry was found.
    Effectively, this probably has been a rare case in the past because it
    would only have an effect for unknown mime types, extensions etc.

  - Reload now also forces all the images on the page to reload instead of
    possibly getting them from the cache.

  - Fixed a bad memory leak when object caching was turned on (i.e. always)
    which would leak the entire transfer item generated from the parser.

  - Major revision of URL driver interface:

     * Added auto-detection of URL drivers. As a result, all the mechanisms
       related to INI-based configuration were removed from the code (like
       setting default driver configurations). "[htmlview]/URL Drivers" is no
       longer used.

     * Revised URL driver interface (upgraded to protocol 3.0) to support
       auto-detection by exporting an additional "info" function similar to
       Mime drivers.

     * Parameters to and from URL drivers are now passed in a data block.
       See htmldrv.h for details.

     * Added parameters for flagging items as non-cachable and for date-based
       conditional fetching and expiration.

     * Post Data is now always freed by the caller of the driver, not by the
       driver itself, to avoid confusion about handling error situations.

     * Wmg3Http, Wmg3Ftp, Wmg3Ext: adapted to updated URL Driver protocol.

     * Wmg3Ext: changed INI entry structure to

       [extURL]
       apps = {
         mailto mail,0
       }

     * Error messages returned by drivers are flagged as "no cache".

  - Revised Mime driver interface (upgraded to protocol 3.1): a fixed buffer
    is now passed to the MimeDrvInfo entry point in which the information
    about supported types should be returned.

     * ImpGraph, ImpDoc: adapted to updated Mime Driver protocol.

     * ImpDoc: fixed bug which would create an incorrect mime type list
       if more than one type was specified (missing double zero terminator
       after extension).

  - Lookup of drivers for mime types and protocols is now case insensitive
    to avoid confusion.

  - Added support for URB_RF_NOCACHE and URFB_RF_FILE_REDIR return flags from
    driver (replacing old URL_RET_FILE_TEMPORARY and URL_RET_FILE_REDIR
    return types).

  - In URLs that contain "username:password@server", the user name and
    password portion are no longer normalized to lower case when executing a
    link.

03/06/99 GPC version (Lysle):

  - Animations!  Animated GIFs has been added.  Graphics are allowed to
    have the following characteristics:
       * Transparency
       * Minimal flashing (still some optimizations left)
       * Looping or set number of times to repeat
       * Other formats besides animated GIFs can now be supported
       * Stored in the formatting cache for quick retrieval
       * Animations start animating even while downloading page
       * Animations can be turned off by changing the GEOS.INI as follows:
             [impgraph]
             allowAnimatios = false

  - Fixed a crash related to small images being scaled down to zero as
    part of the aspect ratio.  If the width or height is zero, it bumps
    it back up to 1.  Otherwise, the text library is unhappy.

03/06/99 GPC version (GPC):

  - Changed HTML_MAXBUF and URL_MAX_PATH from 256 oto 512 to allow longer
    URLs

  - ImpDoc:  MIME driver for launch application based on a file extension.
    Add to the .ini file:
        [mimeDoc]
        fileTypes = {
        application/install PAK SYMR,0
        application/update PUK updt,0
        }
    First is MIME-type, then file extension, then GeodeToken

  - WMG3HTTP:  Small changes to allow COOKIE_ENABLE without SSL_ENABLE

  - URLDOC:  Restored ATTR_VIS_TEXT_WRAP_AFTER_OVERFLOW.  Use with new
    kernal library (GEOS.GEO)

03/03/99 GPC version (Marcus):

  - Fixed (new in 03/01/99 version): globe would not start spinning in some
    cases if loading of a page was interrupted by clicking on a link while
    pages were still coming in.

  - Fixed: clicking on a link to an anchor in the current page would still
    cause the page to be reloaded from the formatting cache.

  - Fixed: Clicking on an anchor in a page would flash the page briefly if
    there had been any images of unknown size on it ("layout dirty" flag
    wasn't reset).

  - "Save Page" command is disabled if there is no page to save. [GPC bug
    #406]

  - "Delete Local Page" is disabled (and closed) if there are no local pages.

  - Reinstated: Password fields are now shown as "*" when entered in the
    dialog box. [GPC bug #127] [was lost in 02/15/99 update]

  - Reinstated: If a single-selection drop down menu has now option selected
    by default, the first option is automatically selected. [GPC bug #144]
    [was lost in 02/15/99 update]

  - Reinstated: List box for form select elements now expands depending on
    text size. [GPC bug #179] [was lost in 02/15/99 update]

  - Changed Stop button bubble help text to "Stop the current download".
    [GPC bug #477]

  - Added support for <p align=justify>. [GPC bug #259]

  - Fixed an internal bug in FreeElementArray() of htmlclas\htmlclas.goc which
    caused the element arrays of the text object to be freed as if they were
    huge arrays when in fact they were LMem blocks in VM. For some reason even
    the EC versions of Geos 3.0 would free them properly, while the 2.0 NC
    target fatal'ed immediately when shutting down the application.

  - Updated bboxlog logging to support multi-threaded connections.

03/01/99 GPC version (Marcus):

  - Removed internal support for loading graphics by Geos Impex drivers.
    This functionality should be moved into a "liaison" Mime driver to avoid
    having to deal with two types of graphicss types in WM.

  - Simplified code for loading graphics from the formatting cache.

  - When loading a page that only contains images stored in the formatting
    cache, unnecessary screen updates are now suppressed.

  - Added "-dc" option to Borland C compiler flags. This forces text constants
    to be stored in code segments rather than dgroup, which reduces dgroup
    (fixed) size by about 1k each for gpcbrow and html4par.

  - Changed strategy for updating history list to make sure that only the
    last visited page with a given title is listed. This avoids duplicate
    entries which cannot be told apart by the user anyway... Also, the
    history list now already includes the currently viewed page as its
    topmost entry.

  - Redesigned internal notification system for completion of certain loading
    stages as a basis for other modifications.

  - Point size and default font can now be configured by INI settings, as well
    as whether reduced point sizes should be increased in "Intro" UI mode:

        [HTMLView]
        defaultFont = <font ID>
        defaultPointSize = <point size>
        introDefaultFont = <font ID>
        introDefaultPointSize = <point size>
        introNoReducedSizes = <true/false>

  - Split up urldoc.goc and urlframe.goc into two modules.

  - Added "Update Current Page" to Local menu.

  - Local page list and history have the entry corresponding to the currently
    viewed page marked as active selection.

  - Added support to Mime Driver API for drivers which return a text-like
    import format (either an HTML message or a transfer item). These drivers
    can also be used for implementing "helper apps" for specific file types
    (see htmldrv.h for details).

  - Formatted pages are now stored to the formatting cache with images already
    inserted. This increases the speed of going back to such a page because
    images don't have to be loaded seperately.

  - Loaded local page are now copied to the formatting cache so going back to
    them in history doesn't cause a network access.

02/22/99 GPC version (Lysle):

  - Favorite listings have been widened

  - Added modify group dialog box

  - Code has been added to allow folders and entries to be pushed up and down.

  - Items in folders (and even folders in folders) is working now.

  - Correctly handle enabling/disabling of buttons in the Organize dialog.

  - Add Top Ten list feature and toggling to that list.  This includes
    correctly making the menu show up for top ten or favorites.  And for
    showing normal favorites, the groups are skipped.

  - Correct problems in the IBMS library.  Most problems were either
    forgetting how to handle folders or incorrectly linking on insert and
    delete commands.

  - Split up the favorite UI region because some of the areas can expand
    to contain many graphics.

  - Added icons to the favorites displayed on the menu and lists.

02/21/99 GPC version (Marcus):

  - Fixed some little things about highlighting hotspots, related to image
    maps and selecting a link from the keyboard. [GPC bug #134]

  - Added support for HSPACE and VSPACE attributes to IMG tag. [GPC bug #148]

  - If only either WIDTH or HEIGHT is specified for an image, the aspect ratio
    of the image is now maintained.

02/15/99 GPC version (Lysle):

  - Integrated Marcus' and GPC's changes changes.
    NOTE:  Left out GPC's change for parameter handling for the OPTION tag.

  - Fixed problem with large pages not correctly drawing their clear or
    tiled background.  The coordinates where extending past 16 bit signed
    numbers.

  - Fixed IBMS library to correctly lock and unlock entries (huge arrays
    have a problem of shifting items and invalidating pointers).

  - Fixed Favorites system to correctly lock and unlock data.

  - New Favorites system is implemented and invalidates all old files.
    Most changes are in the form of data.

  - Correctly handle notes on Favorites.  Now can save/modify/delete.


02/15/99 GPC version (GPC):

  - new MSG_HMLVP_OPEN_URL prototype (htmlview.goh)

  - include iapp.h

  - new MSG_HMLVP_OPEN_URL handler (htmlview.goc)

  - handle MSG_META_IACP_NEW_CONNECTION (htmlview.goc)

  - add mailto = wmg3ext.geo in options.goh

  - new wmg3ext URL protocol handler

  - added to GEOS.INI:
    [extURL]
    mailto = mail,0

  - new header file (iapp.h)

  - add RECV_SPEED compilation constant that enables showing
    receive speed in status line (Wmg3Http/local.mk)

  - RECV_SPEED: start time instance data for connection (Wmg3Http/Wmg3con.goh)

  - RECV_SPEED implementation (Wmg3Http/Wmg3http.goc)

  - fix handling of null-value cookies (deletes existing
    cookie with same name)  (Wmg3Http/cookies.goc)

  - fix parameter handling for OPTION tag (Html4Par/htmlpars/opentags.goc)
    [NOTE:  Overruled by Lysle]

  - add error handling for memory allocations (UrlDrv/Wmg3Ext/wmg3ext.goc)


02/13/99 GPC version (Marcus):

  - Password fields are now shown as "*" when entered in the dialog box.
    [GPC bug #127]

  - Autoforwarding ("Meta Refresh") now also works if browser was compiled
    with Auto Browsing enabled.

  - Default shape for image map areas is now rect, rather than default.
    [GPC bug #137]

  - Maximum length in <INPUT> elements is now specified by MAXLENGTH, not by
    MAXLEN (which was incorrect).

  - Improved parsing for contents of TEXTAREA (now also allows line breaks in
    contents), OPTION and TITLE. Among other things, this fixes problems
    occuring if other tags or comments appeared within the contents of these
    tags. [e.g. in GPC bug #144]

  - If a single-selection drop down menu has now option selected by default,
    the first option is automatically selected. [GPC bug #144]

  - History menu now shows a disabled entry "(none)" instead of being empty.

  - List box for form select elements now expands depending on text size.
    [GPC bug #179]

  - Made sure that application UI level is set to the system wide UI level.
    This is required to properly remove the "View at %" in CUI mode.

  - In CUI mode, the default font size is now 14 points, and all requests in
    the page to set the font size below that level are ignored.

  - Suggested file name for a local page will now have characters like "*",
    "?", ":" removed so it will work correctly if the user just hits Enter.

  - If more than 15 local pages are stored, the user is asked to delete one
    before saving a new one.

02/07/99 GPC version (Lysle):
  - Added bubble help

  - Fixed a bug drawing the background of very large pages (uses 32 bit
    coordinates now instead of 16 bit).

  - Still more work on bookmarks, but not ready for the big leagues yet.

02/07/99 GPC version (Marcus):

  - Removed boolean settings and Miscellaneous dialog in Options menu. Both
    can be controlled by COMPILE_OPTION_ENABLE_SETTINGS/MISCELLANEOUS.

  - Changed "Load Graphics Automatically" in View menu to toggle, and added
    Load Graphics Now as described in the revised specs. The Load Graphics
    toggle is now an independent object from the other boolean settings
    so it can be more easily moved around the menu.

  - Changed "Enable Toolbar" to alternating "Show/Hide Toolbar" entries.

  - Added "Reset Browser Memory" confirmation dialog.

  - Moved "Delete" button in Delete Local Page DB above divider line.

  - IMPGRAPH: generated bitmaps are compacted after being imported.

  - Removed Notes field in Save Local Page DB.

  - </TR> alone will now delimit a table row (e.g. www.organicstoyou.com ->
    "What's in the bin?").

  - Replaced current NameArray based name pool system by one that uses a
    combination of a hash table in a chunk array and a huge array for string
    storage. This removes limitations both for maximum string size and for
    total pool size. As a result, all previously generated Local Page files
    are now incompatible.

  - Removed NamePoolRename() and NamePoolRenameLen() functions which haven't
    been used anyway and which would break the whole name pool concept.

  - Removed Find Previous command in Find dialog box.

  - Removed "View at %" in CUI (UIIL_INTRODUCTORY).

  - Fixed another bug related to saving local pages with image maps that
    could lead to crashes when saving the page.

  - Image maps are now saved with local pages. This also makes Local Page
    files incompatible, hopefully for the last time.

  - Moved list of Local Page files into Local menu.

02/02/99 GPC version (Lysle):

  - Integrated back in the GPC changes to the form submission.  This is
    important because some sites (like the Earthlink subscription service)
    requires the data on the submit button to be passed in to the cgi
    scripts (apparently a statement machine identifier because they have
    a Next submit and a Back submit button).

  - New artwork for toolbars are added (Simple Toolbar) and use the new
    moniker definitions.  Since the monikers use the COMBINATION text and
    graphic hint, on all non-GPC targets, only the graphic is shown.

  - New 15 frame 24 bit spinning globe artwork has been added.  Very nice.

  - 2 pixel black, 1 pixel white border has been added to the globe.  It
    appears the space was always there.

  - Spinning globe now uses GrDrawImage and bitmaps instead of GStrings.

  - Favorites is quite there yet, but the new IBMS library has been setup
    and included in the new build.  This library will provide the base
    level data organization for trees.

  - Added HINT to the URLText object so that it no longer draws lines
    on the GPC version.

  - Removed the file menu and replaced it with a new one that doesn't
    have the New/Open option and a correctly named Exit option.

  - Made the Load Graphics button a compile option.

  - Changed to new app icon and tiny icon.

  - Tried making all URLText objects use the new HINT to stop breaking up
    words, but it failed to work correctly.  Commented out for now.

  - Put in new hotspot pointer.

01/30/99 GPC version (Marcus):

  - Added COMPILE_OPTION_AUTO_SAVE_OPTIONS: if enabled, the Save Options menu
    item is removed, and all options are saved to the INI file when the
    program is exited.

  - Rearranged most menu items according to GPC specs and added a number of
    other COMPILE_OPTION_* defines to enable/disable unwanted features.

  - "Enable Toolbar" now works with the simple toolbar.

  - Added a few more uses for the EnabledOrNot() routine.
                                                         
01/29/99 GPC version (Marcus):

  - Fixed a problem that would cause name tokens to be improperly handled
    when storing map arrays in a Local Page savefile.

  - Strategy to determine the minimum required width for a line now allows
    for one extra pixel beyond the specified region width because the
    formatting routines will apparently tolerate this as well. Otherwise,
    the minimum required line size could be severely overestimated.

  - IMPGRAPH: For progressive scan JPEGs, the required amount of temporary
    store is estimated and requested through the AllocWatcher. This causes
    large images to be properly rejected rather than running out of memory
    while trying to load them.

  - In a single-document version (as on the Yago), the title of the current
    page is now displayed as the moniker of the application's main window
    rather than that of the document's GenDisplay. This fixes a rare crash
    that is possibly caused by the Yago SPUI when changing the GenDisplay's
    moniker (note that the title bar of the GenDisplay is not visible) and
    at the same time ensures that the title actually becomes visible.

  - Fixed problem that would lead to two consecutive INITIATE_NEW_DOC messages
    being sent if a homepage was specified in the [infoServ] section (only
    used in Yago build). This would cause the first page to briefly open and
    then immediately close again in a single-document version, causing the
    loss of the "END_OPERATION" message for the first document (either as a
    crash or as an eternally spinning globe). Ultimately, this points to a
    deeper problem caused by the application closing a document window while
    other threads (fetch, import) can still hold pointers to it.

  - URLs of hyperlinks with a target attribute are now resolved within the
    context of the source frame instead of the target. This also includes a
    fix to properly generate an absolute path from a link in the form of
    "#anchor".

  - IJGJPEG: reduced minimum size for some types of allocations to avoid
    creation of one large (16k) chunk.

01/19/99 GPC version (Marcus):

  - Fixed bug in HTMLVIEW.GOC that would keep the toolbar "usable" states from
    being changed by the new version of UpdateToolbar(). This would for
    example keep the little button toolbar from appearing.

  - Split up parstags.goc into two files.

01/18/99 GPC version (Marcus):

  - Added NEW_FEATURES compile option for experimental features.

  - First version to support saving and loading of local pages.

  - VisContent object of a frame is now sent MSG_VIS_DESTROY before releasing
    its memory block.


=== branched Brother version ===


01/13/99 version (Marcus):

  - Added check to wmg3http that returns an error message if the amount of
    data received does not match the content size in the header.

  - Added COMPILE_OPTION_CACHE_ENTRY_COUNT_LIMIT to limit the number of
    entries that can be added to the cache (to reduce the load on the name
    pool if pages with a large number of small files are stored).

  - Reduced default cell limit in html3par to 250 (from 500) to avoid creation
    of large (20k) cell records.

  - Prepared html3par for use of local.mk compile options.

01/03/99 version (Marcus):

  - Changed code for enabling/disabling the various UI elements to a structure
    that is more easily maintainable, especially with all the conditionals
    introduced recently...

  - Stop button now also stops the auto-browsing system, which is now also
    restartable after being stopped once.

  - Added stack probes to every routine in EC version (webmagi2, html3par,
    wmg3http).

  - Reduced stack usage of ToolsResolveRelativeURL() by about 256 bytes
    (was more than 1000 bytes before) to decrease stack load when used from
    RedirectURL() in a fetching engine's child thread.

  - Added seperate #defines in htmlview.goh for VM and source cache. This
    is mostly intended for testing purposed on the Yago, to temporarily move
    the source cache temporarily to a non-volatile drive for catching
    files that crash the system after download.

  - Ensured that element arrays are also freed when text objects storage is
    freed. The default behavior for large text object doesn't support this.

12/26/98 version (Marcus):

  - Fixed: a newly introduced bug would cause tables not to be closed properly
    in all cases, causing the following text to be squeezed into the last
    cell.

  - Simplified code to handle <TR> tag to avoid possible leaking of TR tags
    on the tag stack.

  - Added dummy pointers to be passed to some ElementArray...() routines to
    please the over-zealous EC routines in the Yago.

  - Added some optimizations to the drawing routines for table frames (fast
    checking of the clipping area and reduction of inter-segment calls)
    to speed up scrolling in complex pages.

12/24/98 version (Marcus):

  - Fixed: For a number of combinations of form elements, the data block
    generated for posted, url-encoded forms would be missing the "&"
    seperators after the first few data entries (making e.g. www.amazon.com
    unusable). [Brother bug #174]

  - Fixed: The parser would incorrectly parse the "accept" attribute with
    <INPUT type=image ...> elements, rather than with type=file, as intended.

  - Bad HTML: if an unknown type is specified in an <INPUT> element, the
    parser now defaults to a TEXT element (e.g. www.winatwarehouse.com).

  - Fixed: possible crash when a frame dimension in pixels is specified which
    is larger than the available size (e.g. www.barnardos.org.uk).

  - Simplified Fetch Extra Memory mechanism by synchronizing through MemPLock
    rather than through inter-thread calls. This should more effectively
    decouple process and fetching thread.

  - FTP/HTTP: changed the wording of some error messages.

  - FTP: now returns an empty mime type to permit automatic file type
    detection by extension to kick in (this way, files downloaded via FTP can
    also be viewed in WM).

  - The ALIGN attribute to MENU and BLOCKQUOTE is now ignored, rather than
    forcing the justification to be "left". [Brother bug #155, related to
    #4, #44, #49]

  - "<" and ">" in quoted tag arguments no longer terminate the argument.

  - Fixed: When tags causing their contents to be invisible (e.g. <SELECT>)
    appeared in preformated text, any carriage returns within them would still
    be passed through to be visible in the output text, sometimes leading
    to large vertical blanks.

  - HTMLTextClass now always sets the background of its view to be transparent
    (causing no background redraws on invalidations). Background color is now
    applied in the same way as background imagery in the MSG_VIS_DRAW handler
    for the text object. This allows for some simplications in the way updates
    to the background color are handled (e.g. it fixes the problem with
    colored backgrounds not being drawn when the view first opens). This also
    paves the way for future optimizations in the drawing mechanism to avoid
    multiple draw operations for layering background color, background image,
    table cells and foreground text. (Off-screen buffers come to mind...)

  - Fixed: when a frameset was loaded into a named frame, that frame's name
    would get lost (causing problems for example on the new NewDeal site).

12/14/98 version (Marcus):

  - URLs with unknown protocol now default to FTP rather than HTTP if the
    server name starts with FTP. [Brother bug #165]

  - Fixed problem with displaying remote URLs pointing directly to images
    (e.g. older pictures of the week on www.rock103.com). This was a
    consequence of the LONGFILE: fix. [Brother bug #37 as of 12/11]

  - In AutoBrowsing mode, URLs are now called with DIR_GO attribute, rather
    than DIR_ABSOLUTE, to make sure that any existing URL context is ignored.
    (This became necessary as a result of the LONGFILE: fix.)

  - In MSG_URL_TEXT_GRAPHIC_FETCHED, made sure that a block containing an
    error message is only freed if the message is located at the very start
    of this block (i.e. the chunk part of the optr is 0). Otherwise, we would
    also free our own LMem resources holding localizable messages, leading to
    nasty crashes further downstream.

  - Made sure that a bookmark can also be set for a page which has no title
    (e.g. a text file). Also ensured that no dynamically allocated buffers
    from NamePoolCopy will be leaked if they are ever introduced. ;-)

  - Text objects are now initialized to zero height when first built, instead
    of MAX_REGION_HEIGHT.

  - Modified the basis for frame size calculations somewhat to give more
    accurate values when dividing the screen by percentages.

  - If a frame is marked non-scrolling, the horizontal scroller is also
    properly removed (this didn't happen before).

  - Scrolling frames now always have scrollers, not just if the page is larger
    than the view. This avoids the problem with horizontal scrollers starting
    up out of reach on the GeoBook. [Brother bug #163 and variants] It should
    also reduce redrawing that occurs because a page is added or removed
    scrollers.

  - Removed provision for scroller width again in page width calculation of
    HTMLTextClass, since scrollers are now there all the time anyway.

  - Limited size allocated for spread data structure to what is actually
    required for current amount of columns.

12/07/98 version (Lysle):

  - Made a Skipper Pro compile version

  - Subclasses the View control to change the way redraw works.  Redraw now
    redraws the entire UI.  [Brother bug #113]

  - Made the Heap Leak Finder library that tracks blocks that never get
    released.  This method ensures that if you allocate something and never
    free it, it will be found.  WebMagick passed the test and no handle
    leaks were detected.  [attempt to get Brother bug #36 and #37]

  - Keyboard problem where the hot keys stop working is now fixed.  The
    specific UI would called MSG_GEN_APPLICATION_IGNORE_INPUT when it
    received a hot key and there was less than 400 handles free in the
    system.  The method was intercepted and the limit changed to 100
    handles.  MSG_GEN_APPLICATION_ACCEPT_INPUT was changed to keep from
    getting EC errors.  [Brother bug #34]

  - Changed the inset amount for pages to 1 pixel from the top and
    2 from the left.  THis gives pages a bit more room.

  - The boundaries of a page are now calculated via the routine
    ICalculateRegionBoundaries.  This ensures that the window view is based
    fully on the regions of the text.  I'm not sure why it wasn't quite
    working before, but this seemed the most powerful method that works
    everytime.  [Brother bug #102 and others]

  - Help has been finalized to fix the Miscellaneous dialog not having help,
    the Find dialog not having the correct help, and the New/Open dialog
    not having the correct help.  [Brother bugs #90, #97, and #98]

12/04/98 version (Marcus):

  - Added provisions for calling up custom help text in the Find (context name
    "dbFindRepl") and Miscellaneous ("Miscellaneous") dialog boxes. [Brother
    bug #97,98]

  - Fixed bug in ISpreadFindAboveSpan(): the inner loop should start from
    to-width+1, rather than to-width. Otherwise, a span could be found
    that doesn't fully enclose the one specified. This caused incorrect
    widths for columns with a specified percentage. [Brother bug #116]

  - Added global limit for the number of images parsed on a single page. This
    key is controlled by the INI file key "imagelimit". [Brother bug #132]

  - Fixed minor bug in MSG_VIS_TEXT_REPLACE_WITH_GRAPHIC that could lead
    to the application forgetting to set the layout "dirty" in rare cases.

  - Fixed a bug in handling of "dirty layout" case at the end of graphics
    import which could result in the document size not being properly set
    (i.e. the scrollers don't cover the entire document, and this can be
    fixed using Recalc). [Brother bug #147]

  - Added SYM button to title bar of "Find" dialog in Yago build as a
    workaround for the SYM button in the application title bar failing to
    bring up the floating keyboard sometimes. [Brother bug #145]

  - Disabled experimental code in ISpreadAdd() which could cause columns to
    be come narrower than the computed minimum width (e.g. www.mp3.com).

  - Made sure that remote graphics are marked "broken" if a URL driver returns
    an error message.

  - Fixed a problem in SpreadCalcPercents() and SpreadCalcProporitions() that
    could lead to the total width of a table extending its requested size.
    [Brother bug #67, 104, 134]

12/01/98 version (Marcus):

  - Inserted a guard against writing beyond the end of a buffer to
    SpreadAddToQueue() in htmlcol.goc. [Brother bug #136]

  - Added some heap checking calls to HTML3PAR code.

  - Made htmlcol.goc use the global constant TABLE_MAX_COLUMNS (from
    internal.h) rather than defining its own.

11/29/98 version (Marcus):

  - Modified big button history menu to use a drop-down list like before,
    which is more consistent with the standard UI. [Brother bug #124]

  - Reintroduced code to conditionally include the width of a potentital
    scroll bar in the width calculation of the view, since removing it
    actually made things worse. Added a check to provide for a scroll bar only
    if the view is actually scrollable. Also modified the scroll bar width
    estimate by 4 pixels to give equal effective view widths with and without
    scroll bar on the Yago.

  - Fixed missing indents after <BR> in <LI> items.

  - Uncommented "resource" line for URLFETCH_TEXT in webmagi2.gp again.
    Got occasional crashes on Yago2 if URLFETCH_TEXT was not fixed.

11/28/98 version (Marcus):

  - FTP/HTTP: changed SocketClose() to CloseSend/Reset/Close sequence.

  - HTTP: Included abort check in SocketRecvNice() loop to speed up aborting
    even without having to rely on SocketAbort().

  - If an unknown URL scheme (like HTTPS://... or MAILTO://...) is used,
    the program displays a proper error message again, rather than just
    using the old driver on the URL. This changes the error message reported
    on http://tigerweb.memphis.edu, although it doesn't really solve the
    problem of missing SSL support. [Brother bug #130]

  - The HTMLTextClass object now maintains all the different arrays (cells,
    links, images, forms etc.) in seperate blocks of global memory rather than
    a single "array" block at display time (they are still crammed together in
    one block during parsing!). This should ease fragmentation problems
    similar to the one causing problems for the MP3 "plugins" page. [Brother
    bug #132]

  - As a result, some code had to be changed which worked on the assumption
    that certain arrays (e.g. table and cell) would be stored in the same
    block and thus always be locked at the same time.

  - Added SYM buttons to the title bars of the modal text entry dialogs
    for form fields [Brother bug #88].

  - Added check for underflow in IDivideFixedSpan() in htmlcol.goc. This
    changes the appearance of Brother bug #67 (www.cnet.com) somewhat: graphic
    links are now properly displayed, but the rightmost graphic cannot be
    reached for lack of a horizontal scroller. This is probably a different
    bug.

  - Made some changes for compilation under NT (renamed MANAGER.ASM in
    assembly langauge components), added segment name pragma to urlfetch.goc,
    renamed Include directory to CInclude.

11/22/98 version (Marcus):

  - FTP: avoided endless loop in sock_getline() if SockRecv() fails.

  - FTP: added some other error checking already implemented in HTTP.

  - Made sure that no "Loading Image" message will stay in the status bar
    if image loading is aborted.

  - Changed URL Fetching engine to maintain seperate Abort functions for
    each child thread. This is required if multiple URL drivers are used
    concurrently (e.g. images referenced by both HTTP and FTP, or an FTP
    URL ist entered while images are still loading). In this process,
    re-enabled the use of the Abort function during graphics loading
    (which was effectively turned off after the first graphic had loaded).

  - Removed QueryAborted() checking in PROCESS_GRAPHICS module of URLText,
    as this method usually gets executed very quickly anyway, since all the
    processing is now off-loaded to other threads (exception: many graphics
    are coming from formatting cache, which is not an issue at the moment).

  - Changed abort mechanism in Import engine to queue-based strategy similar
    to Fetching engine. Together with the previous change, this makes sure
    that graphics on the following page will be loaded even if the user
    clicked on the link before all images have come in. [Brother bug #126]

  - Ensured that URL drivers are not freed by another thread if they are
    still used by one (e.g. if an FTP URL is entered while HTTP graphics
    are still loading).

  - Screen width is unconditionally computed with space reserved for the
    vertical scroll bar to avoid need for reformatting or a very small
    amount of horizontal scrolling.

  - Enabled floating keyboard support for primary window (and all its child
    dialogs). SYM key works now. [Brother bug #88]

11/19/98 version (Lysle):

  - Fixed the calculation of table cells that are over non-existing table
    spots (such as 3 cells in a table with room for 4).  The problem was the
    cell at the top with the empty cell below it would get expanded down
    into the empty cell and cause vertical alignment to be wrong.  In some
    cases, particularly tables in tables, this would cause overlapping
    graphics.   [Marcus' test table]

  - Fixed centering for rowspan cells.  It was incorrectly determining the
    vertical location and placing it typically too high.  [Marcus' test
    table]

  - The target token was not being TokenUsed for ISMAPs in HOTSPOT_NOTIFY.
    Now fixed.   [Brother bug #73]

  - Added source cache limit compile option.  For yago, its 400Kb, for
    desktop its 16384Kb.  [Brother bug #111 and #112]

  - BLOCKQUOTE is now forced to left justify.  [Brother bug #44]

  - TEXTAREA data is now stored as a memory block instead of a name pool
    object (which was limited to 256 characters).  This avoids a crash
    when the user edits and enters alot of text.  [Brother bug #61]

11/09/98 version (Lysle):

  - MENU blocks no longer allow to be right justified.  Fixed by forcing
    justification to always be LEFT. [Brother bug #4, #49]

  - OL lists always show their data.  Bug was caused by parser forgetting
    that the list has data to output. [Brother bug #5, #9, and #51]

  - Changed the CTRL-I for "Load Graphics" to a CTRL-G [Brother bug #18]

  - New icons draw correctly now because they have been converted to
    16 colors.  (This just avoids a problem with 256 color images with
    masks, this is not a true fix).  [Brother bug #29]

  - BLOCKQUOTE no longer uses italics.  [Brother bug #44]

  - DL and DT tags would incorrectly indent lines.  Indenting has been
    turned off for these tags.  [Brother bug #46]

  - H6 tag was being rendered in Italics, but a bigger font.  A smaller
    font is used and italics is not used.  [Brother bug #47]

  - TEXTAREAs would crash when too much text is entered.  A limit of
    6000 characters has now been placed on the text.  In addition,
    INPUT lines now have a limit of 512 characters to also avoid a
    similar problem.  [Brother bug #61]

  - The text entry box does not display properly after too much text
    is entered on the TEXTAREA page.  This problem was fixed by setting
    a set size dialog box and making sure the text object always has
    a scroll bar (which keeps it from expanding vertically).
    [Brother bug #62]

  - Same as 5.  First line of data was getting flushed.  [Brother bug #65]

  - Graphics were not showing or were clipping because data was not being
    completely being received.  Timeout of 30 seconds was increased to
    90 seconds because the timeout occured when multiple connections
    were open and one socket was getting all the data.  [Brother bug #70]

  - Added layout dirty condition when images are drawn but their size
    is different than the given space.  This is part of the non-flashing
    optimization.  (see below)

  - To also help pages not flash, images without sizes determinated are
    reserved a space 10x10 pixels until the final pass is rendered instead
    of the normal [Image] tag seen in past versions.  This keeps the text
    from reflowing automatically by the text system.

  - Impgraph now correctly imports monochrome images.  (was reversing
    black and white for some images).

11/08/98 version (Marcus):

  - Changed hotkey for "Load Graphics" from Ctrl-I to Ctrl-G to make it
    easier to remember. [Brother bug #18]

  - Removed special case which avoided stretching/compressing a graphic when
    either of the specified dimensions was 1 pixel (to avoid problems with the
    graphics systems). This would lead to frequent reformats when such 1-pixel
    images were used as "spacer GIFs". We may have to keep in mind that the
    change could uncover some hidden problems in the Geos graphics subsystem.

  - URLs displayed in status bar are now always complete. [Brother bug #39]

  - A frame is now only redrawn at the end of loading a page if the layout
    really has been changed from the initial assumption (i.e. before the
    actual graphics have been loaded). Right now, this should only happen
    because of a graphic with an unspecified size.

  - A tag sequence like "<I><P>...text...</I>...more text..." will no longer
    create an (incorrect) line break after the </I>. [Brother bugs #57,58]

  - When the user zooms in/out on the view, the contents are now forced to be
    redrawn to make sure the screen image matches the computed layout.
    [Brother bug #76]

  - Added support for PLAINTEXT tag. [Brother bug #54] As part of this,
    straightened the code for handling the PRE family of tags somewhat.

11/02/98 version (Lysle):  NOTE:  some may be a bit older, just catching up.

  - Moving cursor over map on www.dejanews.com causes a crash.  Should
    be fixed now, but need to check.

  - GlobeHopper version compiled.  (all related names)

  - Yago 98 version does not use Tex2 library.

  - NB-60 version only uses two threads for downloading.

  - Yago versions do not have Fax, HTML edit, scroll bar options, or
    multiple windows.

  - Large buttons added for Brother's GlobeHopper version.  Several more
    graphics were added.  Correct activitation/deactivation code was
    also added.

  - Proxy featured added to Configuration menu for network (and
    general proxy support).

  - CTRL-A is now an add bookmark hotkey.

  - Internal copyrights have all been changed to say 'Breadbox ....'

  - User notes have Breadbox copyright.

  - Opens full screen now.

  - Added special code for Earthlink registration (may be a better way).
    Downloads registration as REG.TXT and puts in the document directory.

  - Now automatically opens to page declared as [InfoServ] homePage
    (if any).  This was done to be compatible with the Yago Internet
    Earthlink subscription.  This was made into a compile option
    and only Yago active.

  - Geode is now called "Web Browser" for Yago version.  The rename was
    necessary to link the browser to the Internet menu choices on the Yago.

11/01/98 version (Marcus):

  - When home page is specified without http:// prefix, going home no longer
    incorrectly appends the home URL to the current one. [Brother bug #30]

  - Changed keyboard accelerator for "Down" button in bookmark dialog
    to "n" to avoid duplication. [Brother bug #35]

10/25/98 version (Marcus):

  - Also implemented delaying of detach message to application process to
    make shutdown during an operation as safe as quitting...

10/19/98 version (Marcus):

  - Made sure that name pool ist not freed while some text objects are still
    around. Fixes crash if system is shut down with WM still running with
    a URL window open.

  - A text object is now only freed when its pending request count reaches
    zero. Fixes crashes when the application is terminated while loading
    graphics.

  - The graphics drivers are now released by MSG_IMPORT_THREAD_ENGINE_KILL
    to make sure that they are around until graphics import has ended.

  - The status text object ignores any changes sent to it after
    deinitialization.

  - Changed the way impgraph destroys bitmaps (using VM chain routine now)
    to make it work more reliably if UI thread has already been shut down.

  - Moved Start/Abort/EndOperation mechanism into messages received by the
    application object to facilitate synchronization with delayed quitting.

  - An application quit message is now delayed until the current page has
    completed loading (loading is aborted if possible). This makes sure that
    the application is only closed when all the fetching threads have settled
    down. Should take care of quit-related crashes.

  - Speeded up aborting of image import when a number of images are still in
    the queue to be processed (useful in cases where fetching is very fast and
    most time is taken up by importing, e.g. local files).

  - wmg3http returns a proper error message if receiving data was aborted
    by some other reason than the connection being closed from the remote
    side. This should take care of the half-loaded pictures - they shouldn't
    display at all now...

10/12/98 version (Marcus):

  - Globe is now always shown, not just when it rotates.

  - Fixed two "MemLock on object block" warnings related to selection
    of form elements.

  - Fixed: Disabling COMPILE_OPTION_FORMATTING_CACHE_ON would still leave the
    formatting cache on through the DEFAULT_VARIOUS_SETTINGS variable on
    non-Yago builds.

  - Fixed a bug that would prevent "Save HTML Source" from working when
    formatting cache was turned on.

  - Fixed early termination of DT/DD tags when a closing tag was encountered
    in their body text (e.g. Topgun page).

  - Event threads (import, fetching) are now properly destroyed using
    MSG_META_DETACH().

09/14/98 version (Marcus):

  - BORDER attribute to TABLE tag defaults to 1 if a non-numeric value is
    specified (e.g. BORDER=basic). [Brother bug #1]

  - VALIGN attribute to TR tag is now supported for specifying a default
    alignment for the entire row.

  - For FRAMESET, the ROWS attribute is only accepted if it lists more than
    one frame's height. In situations where both ROWS and COLS are specified,
    this gives priority to the dimension where the actual split takes place.

08/23/98 version (Lysle):

  - Made the URL_FETCH code resource fixed since it is locked all the time.
    This ensures that the code block is NOT sitting in the middle of the
    heap and promoting memory fragmentation.

  - Opening a frame paged by typing in a location on the harddrive will
    cause an EC crash.  The a call to compare URL tokens was being called
    when one token was NULL (the current URL).

  - Fixed a problem with graphics trying to draw on the screen with the
    wrong coordinates via an invalidate.  This would cause an EC occur
    to occur on the NewDeal home page (coming off of my harddrive) when
    drawing the arrows on the left side of the screen.  The problem was
    that the x, y coordinates are not determined until drawn the first
    time by the MSG_VIS_TEXT_VARIABLE_GRAPHIC_DRAW method.  Then after
    can the object be invalidated.  This keeps invalidations from occuring
    until the text has flowed and generated its position.

  - Made it so that when you are highlighting a link and exit, the EC
    version doesn't give an EC crash, just an EC warning.  (See
    STATUS_TEXT_DEINITIALIZE).

  - The Brother home page would crash when the cursor is moved over the
    list of countries to visit.  The problem was that the area map used
    a 'default' shape to catch all other clicks and the code is written
    to pick out a number of coordinates following that entry.  Since a
    default had no coordinates, no information is stored AND the next
    coordinate data is off the end of the data block (and into some other
    block).  In EC, this usually is 0xCCCC and thus it would try to pick
    out 0xCCCC/2 coordinates.  What made this worse was the fact that the
    coordinates were being stored in an array called 'poly' that wasn't
    checked for overflow.  Therefore, more data than should was stored
    in the array and eventually overwrote the call stack causing a very
    bad crash on return.

08/23/98 version (Marcus):

  - Added COMPILE_OPTION_MULTIPLE_WINDOWS to options.goh to create a
    single-document version (cannot open more than one URL view, Window menu
    removed).

  - Added COMPILE_OPTION_FORMATTING_CACHE_ON to options.goh to control
    formatting-cache related options (on/off and size).

  - Added COMPILE_OPTION_ENABLE_LOGGING to options.goh to control use
    of log file library.

  - Reorganized options.goh and included it globally from htmlview.goh.

  - wmg3http: Added "Host:" parameter for POST request (only for GET before).

  - Fixed memory overwrite problem for "default" imagemap area.

  - Added S tag as synonym for STRIKE. [Brother bug #6]

  - Fixed incorrect flags for GenViewControl toolbox features that allowed
    "Scale to Fit" to be added to the toolbar.

  - Added/changed some hotkeys for menu entries. [Brother bugs #15, 16, 17]

  - Added XMP and LISTING tags as synonyms for PRE. [Brother bugs #3, 10]

  - Added COMPILE_OPTION_CUSTOMIZE_TOOL_BARS to options.goh to control
    "Customize Tool Bars" menu option.

  - Moved "Make New Home" trigger into Miscellaneous menu to make it more
    consistent with "Clear Cache" trigger.

  - History menu is turned off if while there are no entries.

  - "Load Images" is turned on and off properly again, depending on whether
    there are images left to be loaded or not.

  - Some small internal reorganizations of the URL_DOCUMENT/URL_FRAME message
    hierarchy to make its design more consistent.

  - Broken images are now properly flagged as broken, but resolved (to
    make Load Images become disabled eventually).

  - Fixed incorrect closing quotes for <Q>..</Q> tag.

  - Added support for attributes to OL tag: TYPE and START/SEQNUM.

  - Added support for SKIP attribute to LI tag. [Brother bug #5]

  - List items without an enclosing list are no longer indented by a tab.

  - Replaced status bar GenText object by a GenGlyph to decrease use of text
    library resources during download.

08/11/98 version (Marcus):

  - Improved mechanism for frame size calculation to avoid creation of frame
    sets which are larger or smaller than the current document window. Also
    may have fixed bugs where a frame set would be built in a different
    way depending on whether there was another frame set active before
    or not.

  - Frames are no longer reloaded unconditionally when moving back and forth
    between frame set changes.

  - Fixed a bug in FindRegionAtPosition() which returned the wrong result for
    a position at the start of a region. This fixes for example a problem with
    check boxes not visually updating on the GUC's JHT registration form.

  - wmg3http: re-enabled remembering of passwords entered in the dialog box.

  - wmg3http: A password that has been entered in the dialog box will now only
    be resent if a request is made to the same server.

  - Fixed a nasty bug in the document close handling which would cause
    crashes when more than one window was open at a time.

  - Reduced size to which the region is expanded when a graphic is inserted
    that changes the size of the placeholder. The previous value of above
    60000 would most likely confuse the graphics system, being above the
    magic limit of 32767. Now, the value of MAX_REGION_HEIGHT is used
    (which is 20000). Reduces redraws at www.breadbox.com.

08/11/98 Lysle:

  - Correctly reset the table cell count per parsing instead of letting it
    go indefinitely.  The side effect would cause table formatting to stop
    all together and then nothing short of exiting and then returning would
    get it to work.

07/31/98 version (Marcus):

  - Split up globe animation into six resources to ease memory management.

  - impgraph: reduced buffer size from 16k to 1k (same as in HTML parser).

  - Reduced stack usage of LoadURLToFile and LoadURLByDriver by around 250
    bytes each at the time of the call to the driver. Consequently, decreased
    stack size for fetching threads by 500 bytes. More gains can probably be
    made only by extensive use of name tokens for URL passing and parsing.
    This will be required for full support of URLs larger than 256 characters
    anyway.

  - Fixed incorrect opcode in one of the globe animations (removed most of
    the unnecessary back-and-forth translations generated by GSDump'ing
    a GeoDraw object along the way). It now runs a lot more smoothly.

07/21/98 version (Lysle):

  - Added the capability of multiple downloading.  This feature depends on
    having a URL Driver that is re-entrant or else blocks.  This should be
    the case now with Marcus' improved WMG3HTTP and the old D&A stack
    driver would block on multiple accesses anyways.

  - Restructured WMG3HTTP to keep track of all its current threads of
    execution and if they are in an abort state.

  - Stop button now works like it used to.

  - Improved the logic for determining if graphics are being downloaded
    or not.  This has simplified some of the state checking code, but still
    does not allow stop to be pressed per open document.  Stop currently
    stops all actions.

07/24/98 version (Marcus):

  - Fixed problems occuring when a table cell was closed without being
    opened (e.g. www.hotfiles.com).

  - Added new status message "Waiting for data" to wmg3http.

  - Changed a number of @call's to the process thread into @send's to
    decouple import/download threads from process activity (screen redraws).
    In the case of the progress callback, this also required copying the
    text string to a temporary block of global memory.

07/16/98 version (Lysle):

  - When moving the cursor outside of the view, the currently highlighted
    link is turned off.  This makes it easier to see if a download is
    occurring.

  - The formatting cache now does not cause importing graphics to flash
    the whole page.  This was implemented by adding a flag that notes when
    the beginning of graphic importing occurs and when it ends, holding
    back from any reformatting until done.  This should work for both
    source and object cache.

07/16/98 version (Marcus):

  - Reorganized some UI-related code to allow for easier configuration of the
    UI object tree (e.g. "@define NO_TOOLBAR" can be used in htmlv_ui.goh to
    compile a version which does not reference any toolbar buttons).

  - wmg3http: Added "Host: ..." parameter to request (solves problems with
    multiple sites residing on one server, like www.tacf.org or
    www.geoscreweurope.ch).

  - Fixed a potential pself invalidation problem related to frames.

  - Fixed name token using/releasing in connection with fetching redirected
    graphics. For this, I changed URLFetchRequest to explicitly "use" the
    passed token once more before sending the message. This brings it in line
    with the usual rule that name tokens passed in parameters don't have to be
    "used" by the caller. Instead, they are referenced again by the routine if
    it intendeds to keep them in use beyond the duration of the call. Also
    added the complementary extra "free" for the token in the request
    structure received by GRPAHIC_FETCHED.

06/25/98 version (Marcus):

  - Modified stack cleanup at closing of <TD> and <TABLE> to be more radical
    (i.e. all formatting etc. opened within a table cell is unconditionally
    closed when the cell/table ends). More Netscape-like.

  - <TABLE> resets all text style/formatting parameters to default. More
    Netscape-like.

  - Added "middle" as synonym for "center" value to "align" attribute.

06/22/98 version (Marcus):

  - Geometry hints are now propagated across dummy frames down to the actual
    view to give correct window sizes for single-level frame sets (e.g.
    main index page of www.geosuserclub.com).

  - Fixed a newly introduced bug in client side image maps which may have
    prevented recatangular areas from working properly.

  - Added support for POLY shaped areas in client side image maps.

  - In .gp files, added comments for Yago and hwlib alternatives. Also removed
    "tex2" text library variant from the webmagi2.gp file because the use of
    the tex2 library for rendering is determined by html3par. Also, the
    original text library will always be in memory anyway because it is
    referenced by the UI library and others.

  - Reinstated code that would set the content type of a POST request to
    the proper encoding type (always url encoding right now). This should fix
    the problem with searching on www.newdealinc.com etc. This change has
    apparently been lost during integration at one point!

  - Rename global "state" variable in wmg3http/ftp to socketState to avoid
    clash with state parameter to URLDrvAbort entry point, which effectly
    rendered the abort mechanism useless.

06/05/98 version (Lysle):

  - EXEC_NTH_HOTSPOT would crash when given a null array.  Avoid this
    problem, but it causes autobrowsing to halt.

  - Added routine NamePoolTokenIsValid to help check if a name token is
    ok before the NameArray routines are used.  This routine catches the
    error before it is found by the NameArray routines which don't allow
    for an easy backtrace.  I've made this routine choose between FatalError
    or just boolean return value.

  - Spent two days hunting down an illegal freeing of a name token.  Found
    the problem to be in LoadURLToFile.  When a redirection occurs, it
    creates a new name token and frees the previous one.  Since graphics
    are downloaded concurrently, a duplicate of this name token is passed
    around and this duplicate is the only one that gets changed.  Therefore,
    the original name token hangs around and under certain circumstances
    is freed later when the name token has been purged from the name pool.
    To alleviate this problem, I decided to just delete the whole token
    reconstruction code.  I attempted just renaming that name token, but
    decided against it later in case other code pieces depended on it.

  - Added NamePoolTokenRename routine as part of the above fix.  Decided
    against using it, but left the code in place.

  - Fixed an accidental change in UrlFrameClass::MSG_URL_FRAME_GOT_URL
    to free all the frame rec tokens as meta record tokens.

06/01/98 version (Lysle):

  - Added the globe animation in the upper right and removed breadbox
    logo.

  - Made the temporary file be a 'SYNC_UPDATE' VMFile to keep all of the
    blocks in memory instead of being on the drive.

  - Fixed a problem with the source cache growing too big because it
    would not delete multiple items when a larger item was downloaded.  This
    eventually would cause out of drive space problems.

  - Initialize the memlimit in GEOS.INI based on the version.

  - Fixed a problem in the D&A stack when it tried to parse headers
    and statements like "Location: <http://etc./>" would usually cause
    a blank page to appear.  For example:  http://www.TheAtlantic.com/

  - Fixed another problem in the D&A stack when header strings are longer
    than the first block of data.  Overflow strings are now carried to
    the next block and parsed.  This is rare, but occured at
    http://www.netcraft.co.uk/

  - Impgraph now checks JPG files to see if they are truly a jpeg (or
    at least for the first 16 bytes or so).  Otherwise, they are not
    imported.  In the past, it would try.

05/31/97 version (Marcus):

  - Improved Auto Browse to also include "Home" actions, and to run longer
    without stopping because a Forward or Back did not execute. Also speeded
    up selection of the link to follow.

  - Improved default size calculation for <INPUT type=text> fields if no
    SIZE attribute is given (should take care of text fields that appear
    with almost no width).

  - Fixed a bug that would keep cell backgrounds within a borderless,
    non-colored table from being drawn.

  - Added support for the BGCOLOR attribute to the <TR> element.

  - Implemented support for meta data in parser.

  - Browser supports <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="<secs>[; url=<url>]">
    feature.


05/18/97 version (Lysle):

  - Table cells are now limited in number.  It doesn't format as cleanly
    as I would like after the limit is reached (I would like the everything
    to go back to the top level), but it recovers nicely.

  - Text parsing is now limited.  Text costs one per character.  Currently
    there is no limit on the amount of styles and fonts.  This may be
    approached later, but typically is not a problem since the different
    styles are compressed into an Element array and the references are in
    a huge array.

  - Long text pages are now handled correctly.  Just were overlapping.

  - Limitation system is now in place to keep the NamePools from growing
    too big.  Tokenizing is now passed a 'required' flag that determines
    if the NameToken is necessary or semi-optional (optional in the fact
    that it will not crash if none is created and will not cause odd
    problems other than it is missing).  This flag allows the system to
    not allocate a NameToken string if the NamePool is getting full.  The
    default limit is 20K but can be changed in the GEOS.INI by adding
    the key 'namepoolmax = ###' where ### is the number of bytes.
    Note that this limit applies to each NamePool, not to the total
    of NamePools.

  - Corrected problem with drawing background colors for cells.  Was not
    drawing in the correct order so a table cell with a background color
    may overwrite an included table background (since all cell backgrounds
    were drawn over all table backgrounds).

  - Now limit the amount of graphics that can be loaded based on an
    estimated allocation amount and done with the allocation watcher
    memory block and support code (see AWATCHER.GOC).

  - Upped the MIME Drv protocol number to 2.1 since the MimeDrvMain call
    has the alloc watcher and pointer to used memory added.

05/18/98 version (Marcus):

  - Added "Save HTML Source" option to "File" menu.

  - A POST request is always executed, even if the URL is the same as the one
    that is currently showing [e.g. report submission on www.browsercaps.com].

  - In a list of coordinates for client-side image maps, a space may now
    also be used as a delimiter instead of a comma [www.browserwatch.com].

  - For each LoadURLToFile() request, a new temporary file name is now
    generated to avoid problems with concurrent file conversion (with the old
    implementation, downloading a new file could fail because the temporary
    file ffffffff.$$$ was currently in use by the conversion thread). This
    should take care of cases where a previously loaded image would
    incorrectly appear somewhere else on a page as well. The temporary file
    is deleted after it has been converted/imported.

  - WMG3HTTP should now properly return an error message if it cannot create
    a file to download into or if writing to a file fails.

  - Fixed possible incorrect interpretation of relative URL paths when the
    frame set is changed.

  - Fixed problems with interpretation of "_parent" target for frame links
    [e.g. www.roughguides.com]

  - A post data block now carries an encoding specification, and WMG3HTTP
    has been adapted to submit an encoding type with the data that is posted
    (currently, only ...-url-encoded is used). This should take care of
    a number of cases where POST failed [e.g. www.bluemountainarts.com].

05/08/98 version (Marcus):

  - Added some cleanup code when a document is closed (to properly discard
    name tokens).

  - A text object's contents are now discarded as soon as the frame is
    deactivated. This keeps it from appearing when the frame is reused, and it
    should also reduce memory usage in general.

  - Put Font and Point Size selection back in.

  - Split "Monochrome" mode into "Ignore Colors" and "Ignore Backgrounds".

  - Modified Fast Mode to display link colors (as a by-product, this also
    includes standard inter-paragraph spacing to the text). Anyway, it
    may be interesting to check how big the advantage of this mode really
    is in the current version.

04/25/98 version (Marcus):

  - Continued updating <LI> handling for new one-stack parsing - should now
    handle incorrect HTML a little better.

  - When a region is created without the view width being known (when opening
    a window), a default width is assumed (rather than zero).

  - Moved code for REQUEST_URL and URL_RECEIVED messages from process class
    to frame class, as they are only called from there anyway. This allows
    for a tighter integration with the internals of the frame class, removing
    some unused flexibility.

  - In MSG_VIS_LARGE_TEXT_APPEND_REGION, added some code to the handling of
    overflowing regions which makes sure that consecutive regions are also
    properly set up with the cell width and x position.

  - Improved detection for overflowing regions - it will now properly handle
    overflowing of the very last cell in the document (usually the text
    after the last table), but it may still fail if a cell in the middle
    grows very large. [see comments in MSG_VIS_LARGE_TEXT_APPEND_REGION]

  - Added "Display HTML Source" to "View" menu.

  - Files parsed as plain text will now also include at least the master cell
    and the topmost table as well to make sure that cell formatting routines
    get the data they are looking for...

04/20/98 version (Lysle):

  - Fixed black backgrounds in tables because color was unknown.

  - Tables now center and right align.

04/14/98 version (Lysle):

  - Rewrote a ton of the table formatting code.  Actually turned out faster.
    As usual, still more special cases to fix and get working.

  - Made region lines disappear by printing instead of drawing.  However,
    this currently messes up selecting links.

  - Made page not appear at all until the complete page is loaded and
    formatted.  Need indicator to make it keep saying it is working.

  - Made the TH tag also bold its text.

04/14/98 version (Marcus):

  - Fixed a name token leak with the <BASE> element.

  - Straightened out the code for some frame related methods in preparation
    for the back/history changes.

  - Started cleaning up a number of little things in the parser to reduce the
    number of "special case" hacks:

    - Combined paragraph/character tag stacks in parser. This also results in
      a different (and hopefully better) handling of improperly nested HTML.

    - Table headings (<TH> cells) are now displayed bold as well as centered
      by default.

    - <Hx> Headings are now properly closed even if the wrong level is used
      (assuming that headings can never be nested).

  - Optimized establishing of a frame set that already existed partially.

  - Forward/Back and History are now also reflecting changes to sub-frames,
    not just links with a new top URL. As a side effect, the history current
    does not provide a true LRU list, but instead may list identical frame
    configurations more than once if you have been going back and forth.

  - Added Ctrl-N ("next") keyboard accelerator for Forward action.

  - An incorrect #anchor link within the same page now goes to the top of
    the page to make sure that *something* happens on the screen and the
    highlight goes away.

  - The parser now includes the requested horizontal alignment for the entire
    table in the HTMLtableData record, while the cell contents are formatted
    left justified by default.

04/02/98 version (Lysle):

  - Turned off the expiration dialog

  - Added compile options (in options.goh) to enable/disable the Font, Size,
    Turncate 8+3, and Add Margin features.

  - Restructure the top toolbar to better handle a larger logo (not that
    the breadbox logo is going to be the final thing).

  - Added extensive Heap Walker Checksum checking.  This was done to help
    find problems before the next demo.  Currently it is turned off.

  - Added recalculate option to see if it would help the table layout.
    It appears not to do any better currently.  Mainly an EC testing
    option.

  - Opening the application now ensures that a default set of .INI settings
    exist if there are not already .INI settings.  This keeps people
    from having to edit the .INI the first time.  (Necessary for demo)

  - Work has been put into making the cache detect the age of files
    and retrieve only new files as part of the HTTP rules.  This method
    has not been completed, but sections of code are in place.  This
    was partily working, but was too buggy for the demo.

  - Added a clear cache command (ObjCacheClear and SrcCacheClear).

  - Added a progress indicator class dialog that appears when downloading.
    Working on getting it to show up for file downloads, not everytime.
    Currently disabled.

  - A new status method has been put in place to organize the 'priority'
    of different status.  Highlighting a link is highest, 'Download done.'
    is the lowest, and everything else is in between.

  - Horizontal scroll bar now appears when page is too wide.

  - A user password dialog now appears when accessing password protected
    sites.

  - Side note:  With all the heap checking code put in place, practically
    no bugs appeared.  However, there either is a bug in the video drivers
    or the graphics import process that is causing junk on the screen
    and other unexplained results.


04/02/98 version (Marcus):

  - Reverted special change for DIV tag, because the normal element flag
    mechanism must be able to handle it properly.

  - Added some new extended characters to the translation table which are not
    part of ISO Latin, but of the Windows ANSI character set, and as such are
    displayed properly by Netscape (see for example "don't" in warrior.htm).
    Also, any &#<code>; combination will now produce a proper character, not
    just the ones for characters which also have entity names.

  - Printouts now contain header/footer with Title, URL, and page number.

  - Incomplete URL redirections are now properly resolved (e.g.
    www.msnbc.com).


03/16/98 version (Lysle):

  - Table borders now defaults to 0 (same as Marcus)

  - Created SPEC_DIV for DIV to correctly insert an EndLine character.

  - Made Skipper compile version

  - Added code to better support proportional sized cells in a table based
    on the longest line in the cell.  This basically ensures better spacing
    when no exact spacing rules are given.  (More like Netscape).

  - Made 3D borders on cells.


03/16/98 version (Marcus):

  - Table border now defaults to 0, in accordance with Netscape.

  - Modified target search in frame hierarchy to comply with HTML 4 specs.

  - Fixed bug which could cause the program to hang when opening a frame set.

  - Added missing FileClose() for cache directory file which kept the program
    from saving the source cache contents at termination.

  - Added support for BGCOLOR attribute to TABLE tag.

  - Any open anchor element is automatically closed when a new anchor is
    encountered (this corrects a type of bad HTML which is for example found
    on www.geoworks.com).


03/07/98 version (Marcus):

  - Added a number of optimizations to table formatting.

  - Completed support for WIDTH attribute to TABLE tag.

  - Improved whitespace handling in connection with tables to reduce the
    amount of empty cells and extra blank space that was occasionally created.

  - Fixed a bug which would occasionally make table cells get out of sync
    with their content (i.e. text ended up in the wrong cell) - anyway, this
    bug was mostly covered by the old whitespace handling.

  - Fixed a bug which could cause an EC out-of-bounds crash in xstrncpy() on
    FILE: URLs with no extension when "truncate names to 8+3" is enabled.

  - Fixed lock leak in source cache routine.


02/24/98 version (from Lysle):

  - POST method no longer caches output in memory (forces RELOAD)

  - Radio buttons are now bitmaps instead of ugly drawn circles.

  - Form text items now are limited by a maximum length

  - Form submit and reset buttons now show named text instead of standard
    "Submit" and "Reset".  Currently, parser makes " submit " appear
    as "submit "  (missing leading space).

  - Form elements with data in the NamePool are now being correctly
    released.


02/24/98 version:

  - Fixed incorrect handling of client side image maps (area shapes were
    confused).

  - Added "-WDE" compiler option to LOCAL.MK for webmagi2 (it was missing from
    my version of the code).

  - Added compiler options to force generation of pure 8086 code (otherwise,
    BCC 4.5 would generate 286+ code).

  - Loading pages in a different frame from the one with the link works again.

  - Modified the way table column widths are iteratively determined to make
    sure that the text object will be updated to the final result.

  - Modified strategy for vertical table layout.

  - Added support for table/cell borders and cell backgrounds.

  - Wash color of text object is now always transparent.

  - Imposed stricter limits on cell sizes to guard against bad HTML.

  - Leading blanks in quoted arguments to HTML tags are kept (multiple blanks
    are compressed to one).


02/17/98 version:

  - Search control works again. [Right now, it may be occasionally necessary
    to click into the window once to activate it.]

  - The 9 pre-created text objects now get a seperate resource each, to
    allow easier growth of the region array and to generally make the job
    easier for memory management.

  - Moved Breadbox moniker glyph into seperate resource, as it creates a
    moniker caching chunk of almost 3K in size.

  - Reduced stack size to 4k for process to avoid allocation of large amounts
    of fixed memory.

  - Fixed lock leak on cache local heap.

  - Fixed an esoteric problem related to <IMG> within <TITLE> (or similar
    cases) and effectively empty HTML files.

  - Specified column widths are now assumed to include cell spacing/padding,
    generally yielding smaller tables...

  - Modified redraw strategy after images have been loaded.

  - Moved reset/submit code for forms into new source file HTMLFORM.GOC.

  - Moved table formatting code into new source file HTMLTABL.GOC.

  - Moved tag handling code in the parser into new source file PARSTAGS.GOC.

  - Added support for client side image maps (except for polygons).

  - Graphical submit buttons <INPUT type=image ...> are now recognized.

  - Fixed bug which would cause a crash because of an invalid name token
    when POSTing a form.

  - Added SUSPEND/UNSUSPEND brackets around form control updates to speed up
    things.

  - Speeded up method of page invalidation after window resizing.

  - Cells now expand to the mininum width required by the largest object
    within them.

  - Page is automatically redrawn after all the images have been loaded.


01/29/98 version:

  - Page now reformats to new width if the window is resized.

  - Fixed problem with frames not properly loading their URLs and eventually
    causing crashes for NamePool errors.

  - Fixed problem which could lead to some frames remaining completely
    blank.


01/26/98 version:

  - Fixed bad parsing for some nested tables (e.g. Yahoo main page).

  - Added parsing for enctype attribute to <FORM> tag.

  - Removed some of the empty regions in tables.

  - Reintroduced printing (although it is currently only a simple form which
    doesn't care about splitting lines or images in half). The new printing
    code will scale down the output to fit within the currently selected
    margins (as in GeoWeb).

  - Avoided brief "flashing" to end-of-text immediately after loading a page.

  - If a page has no title, the window will now display its URL.

  - Object ("Formatting") cache size can now be limited.

  - Name Pool routines are guarded by MemPLock / MemUnlockV synchronization
    (I actually got a crash because they weren't...)


01/19/98 version:

  - Frames and Tables now support proportional ("2*") size specifications.

  - Fixed a possible EC crash in HTMLTextClass,..._GENERATE_NOTIFY

  - Tables are no longer displayed in a cluttered form immediately after
    loading a page.

  - The View menu now contains a Redraw item.

  - htmlv_ui.goh is now an editable file and no longer created from
    htmlv_ui.pvg. htmlv_ui.pvg has been removed from the project.

  - Changes to vertical positioning of table cells.

  - Fixed possible crash when closing window or application.


01/09/98 version:

  - Added support for <DIV> and <SPAN> tags.

  - Added support for <Q> tag.

  - Added support for <DFN> tag.

  - Added support for <BASE> tag.

  - "FRAMEBORDER=0" resp. "BORDER=0" can now also be specified with FRAMESET.

  - Lots of changes to table formatting: added support for percent column
    widths and nested tables, removed problems when loading images into a
    page with tables etc.


12/31/97 version:

  - <OPTION> no longer requires a closing tag.

  - First page already exhibits proper scrolling behavior.

  - Parsed transfer items now contain their own local name pool which is
    copied into the global one when the page is loaded. This way, transfer
    items can be easily destroyed without having to worry about freeing the
    name tokens they used.

  - View automatically grabs focus and target when opening the window,
    so all controllers are properly updated.

  - Contents of <APPLET> tag are ignored.

  - Graphics placeholders are no longer drawn

  - Started implementing table rendering.

  - Temporarily disabled the "Add Margin" formatting option which did not
    work well with tables in the previous implementation.

  - Fixed potential crash when opening select menu.


12/25/97 version:

  - Merged form changes.

  - Changed Name Pool and Association support from object class to functions.

  - NamePoolCopy() now does not return a value, but requires an additional
    parameter to be passed for returning the address of the buffer. This
    parameter can be NULL to make sure that no dynamic buffer is allocated.
    If a "char **" is passed here, the returned pointer *must* be passed to
    NamePoolDestroyIfDynamic() at some later point.


12/23/97 version:

  - Fixed some problems in parsing of form elements.

  - Fixed crash when saving options or trying to configure the toolbar.

  - Fixed a bug which would keep "#..." anchors from working most of the time.

  - Changed display of main text object to "Page" mode (preliminary version:
    always displays page at fixed width, first page loaded is not
    scrollable).

  - Started implementing parser for table tokens.

  - Disabled printing until table layout is fully implemented.


12/14/97 version:

  - Added support for server side image maps ("ismap" images).

  - WM can now open multiple URL viewing windows. This feature uses the
    standard Document mechanism, which means that the program now behaves much
    more like a "standard" Geos application in many ways: for example, files
    can be opened with WM from GeoManager even if WM is already running.

  - Newly supported: ALIGN attribute to H1..H6 tags.

  - Newly supported: BASEFONT tag.

  - Newly supported: FACE attribute to FONT tag.

  - Newly supported: ALIGN, SIZE attributes to HR tag.

  - Fixed bug: SUP and SUB each had just the opposite effect...

  - New loading/parsing strategy for improved performance. As a by-product,
    this also removed the indent of the first line that showed up when turning
    off margins.

  - Completely redesigned internal "object caching" strategy.

  - Anchor definitions in the form of <A NAME="..."></A> now also work if
    there is no text in between the two tags.

  - Added controller for toolbox customization.

  - Automatic regonition of display type: on displays with less than 256
    colors, monochrome optimization is automatically turned on; on tiny
    displays (PDAs etc.) the toolbar and the HTML margins are off by default.

  - Graphics import can now use regular Impex-style filters (which also allows
    the use of vector graphics formats like CGM). Anyway, a "native format"
    for import libraries is still supported for improved performance.

  - Fixed a bug which would cause a background image not to be drawn when
    it was the only image on a page.

  - Fixed a bug in whitespace handling which caused tags not to be recognized
    when they were terminated by a line end or a tab.

  - Frames are now supported (in a limited way) for the first time.

  - URL drivers can now display status and progress messages in the status
    bar.

  - Added Stop buttons and a corresponding menu entry to abort the current
    download operation in the URL driver.

  - Additional information to a mime type returned by a URL driver (for
    example, "text/html; charset=...") is now ignored when identifying the
    type of a file.

  - Source cache size can be limited by using a new option in the
    "Miscellaneous" dialog.

  - Enabled slightly more aggressive compiler optimizations for browser
    and HTML parsing library and upgraded to Borland C 4.52.

  - When a file of unknown type is encountered, there is now a dialog
    which offers to save (i.e. copy) the file to a user-defined location.

  - Default scheme type when entering a URL is now "HTTP", rather than "FILE".
    This means that entering "www.geoworks.com" will automatically be
    interpreted as meaning "HTTP://www.geoworks.com/"

  - New options "Truncate File Names" which enables forcing local file names
    down to 8+3 characters to increase the possibily of successfully loading
    HTML trees stored on DOS partitions. Turning off this option can be
    useful with HTML files that have Geos longnames.

  - Images which have both WIDTH and HEIGHT specified are now represented by
    a graphic placeholder with the right size to minimize reformatting when
    the graphic is loaded.

02/21/97 version: [1.0.0.409]

  - Added "Open" trigger to main toolbar.

  - Arguments of tags (e.g. <IMG ALT=...>) may now contain entity specifiers
    (&...;) and characters above 127. As a result of this change, the handling
    of some improper HTML constructs (like unmatched closing brackets ">")
    has also changed - hopefully to the better overall...

  - Removed keyboard support for Cut & Paste again for URL line until I can
    find a consistent way to distinguish between commands for the URL entry
    field and the main view. These also seem to have caused the printing
    problems some testers reported.

  - Fixed comment handling: comments starting with "<!--" are now terminated
    by the first "-->" encountered, not by the ">" that matches the opening
    "<". Comments starting with "<!" only are terminated by the first ">".

01/23/97 version: [1.0.0.388]

  - Colors specified as hexadecimal RGB values can now be specified without a
    prefixed "#" sign.

  - Fixed a bug which made named colors (like "Purple") case sensitive
    on the first letter (which had to be lower case to be recognized).

  - Reverted to old "flickery" redraw strategy for bitmapped backgrounds to
    avoid problems with transparent wallpaper images.

  - Changed sharing mode to be less restrictive while open a file.

  - Optimized redraw of non-bitmapped backgrounds to reduce flicker when
    background color doesn't change between two pages.

  - WIDTH= and HEIGHT= arguments of <IMG> tag are now supported, specifying
    the size to which the image is to be rescaled.

  - Cut & Paste via keyboard can now be used on the URL entry line as well.

  - Extended maximum size of URL entry line to 255 characters.

  - ALIGN argument of <P> tag is now supported.

  - Improved handling of implicitly terminated tags, e.g. <P>, <LI> or <DD>
    which do not require a corresponding </...> tag.

  - <DD> paragraphs do not have the "keep with next" attribute any more,
    resulting in a more flexible layout when text is copied into Write.

01/09/97 version: [1.0.0.383]

  - Import filter: fixed a minor bug which caused the filter to crash on
    certain GIF images with a non-standard color depth...

01/07/97 version: [1.0.0.383]

  [NOTE: Installer contained outdated version of htmlimpx.geo filter.]

  - Index of source file cache directory is now maintained across sessions in
    a file name webmagic.lst, so entries in the cache can be re-used even if a
    Web connection is no longer active. The format of the index file has been
    chosen so that it can be used as 4DOS-style DESCRIPT.ION file for the
    files in the cache directory. [This item has no meaning if you do not have
    a TCP/IP driver installed.]

  - Enhanced QuickCopy - if you right-click on an image or a character outside
    the current text selection (or if there is no selection at all), the
    graphic under (or near) the cursor is automatically selected. This way,
    graphics with links on them can be easily copied to another application.

  - Import filter now supports transparent GIFs.

  - Color names for the 16 standard colors in HTML are now supported.

  - Removed a problem in the parser which could lead to tag arguments being
    ignored if separated by a newline.

  - Fixed problems with links on graphics where the link target previewed in
    the status bar would not match the actual target. In addtion, multiple
    hotspotted images placed in a row will now properly link to the image
    the cursor is currently on.

  - Optimized redraw strategy when wallpaper-style background images are used,
    resulting in reduced flicker when scrolling.

  - ImpEx filter now supports rudimentary HTML export (only character set
    translations and paragraphs) from GeoWrite.

  - Change "Home" toolbar button to show the image of a house.

  - Added Breadbox logo to the window. :-)

12/10/96 version: [1.0.0.354]

  - Changed the way indents and nested lists work to make the result look
    more like what is expected from other browsers...

  - Removed a bug that caused a KR-09 at startup when no image drivers
    are installed.

  - Added "Forward" command undoing the last "Back" step.

  - Moved "Edit HTML Code" to Edit menu where it belongs...

  - Image placeholder text is now enclosed in "[...]".

  - Removed a bug that could cause incorrect formatting when there were tab
    characters in the HTML file.

  - Added a toolbar, which can also be popped out. If the toolbar is disabled,
    "Forward" and "Back" buttons are still available at the lower right corner
    of the window.

  - Added an option to print the current page.

  - Imported plain text files are now treated as being ISO Latin encoded
    (same as HTML files), instead of using Geos standard encoding.

  - Added options for changing the basic font and point size.

  - Removed a bug which could cause crashes on invalid <A> tags.

  - Modified the way hyperlinks are stored to make it more compatible with
    Bindery (otherwise, copying text from the viewer window to the clipboard
    could cause crashes).

  - "Add Margin" setting is now respected when "Fast Mode" is enabled. In
    addition, "Add Margin" will now control the insertion of a blank line
    at the top as well.

  - Filter: The type of HTML files is automatically detected; anyway, this
    does not work as expected because the ASCII filter also wants to import
    HTML files because they look like plain text.

  - Modified the parser to hopefully get along with more types of bad HTML.

  - Background bitmaps ("wallpapers") and colors are now supported.

  - Text colors are now supported.

  - Support for wallpapers and colors can be disabled using the "Optimize for
    Monochrome" option in the formatting options submenu.

  - New tags supported: FONT, BIG, SMALL, SUP, SUB

  - Removed a bug which has prevented loading of local images sometimes.

  - Images for which there a Mime driver is installed can now be loaded
    directly into the text view by specifying their URL.

  - "Home" triggers are disabled when the home page is currently loaded;
    "Load Graphics" triggers are disabled when there are no graphics to load.
