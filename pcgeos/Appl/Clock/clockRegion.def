DESCRIPTION:
	Interface definition for the ClockRegion module of this here program.
	
	These functions are intended to take a gstring and convert it into
	a region (similar to the path stuff in 2.0). They work only in black
	and white. Anything drawn in white will be inside the region, while
	anything drawn in black will be outside the region.

ClockRegionCode	segment	resource

global	CRCreate:far
;
;	Begin the creation of a ClockRegion. Once created, you can draw
;	things into it as you like, then finally convert it to a region
;	when you're all done drawing.
;
;	Pass:	cx, dx	= width, height of final region
;	Return:	di	= gstate through which to draw into the region.
;		bx	= token to pass back to CRDestroy
;

global	CRDestroy:far
;
;	Free up whatever resources were allocated when the ClockRegion was
;	allocated.
;
;	Pass:	di	= gstate returned by CRCreate.
;		bx	= token returned by CRCreate
;	Return:	nothing
;

global	CRConvert:far
;
;	Convert a ClockRegion to a real one.
;
;	Pass:	ds	= lmem segment in which to allocate the chunk
;			  to create the region.
;		ax	= CRConvertMode
;	Return:	ax	= chunk handle of chunk that holds the region.
