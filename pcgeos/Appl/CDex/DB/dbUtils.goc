		FindNextEntry
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

SYNOPSIS:	Find the next entry taking into consideration the fact 
		that there might be more that one tabs for one letter
		of alphabet. (i.e. 'M' and 'MC' are separate tabs)

CALLED BY:	(INTERNAL) FindNext

SIDE EFFECTS:

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:

	In GeoDex 2.0, you can have more than one letter tabs to represent
	a single alphabet.  For example, if you want to sort all names that
	start with 'MC' (as in 'McDonald') separate from 'M', you can create
	a separate tab for this string, resulting in two tabs for letter 'M'.
	Any entries that start with 'MC' will get sorted into 'MC' tab and
	any other entries that start with 'M' into 'M'.  I will call 'MC'
	to be a subset of letter tab 'M'.  And 'M' the main set.
	Please keep this in mind when reading the following PSEUDO CODE.

	Get the tab letter string of current record
	Save the tab letter string in 'prevLetter'
	Get the tab letter string of the next recored
	Compare this string with the one in 'prevLetter'

	If these strings match, that means both current record
		and the next record belong to the same tab.
		So current record is the next entry to be displayed. 

	If they don't match,
		Compare the 1st letter of 'prevLetter' and 'curLetter'

		If no match, that means the next record belongs to a tab
			letter that is not a subset of the current record
			tab letter.  So find a next letter tab that has
			an entry belonging to it.

		If match, that means the tab letter that next record belongs
			to is a subset of the current one.
			We have possibly more entries that belong to the
	 		current letter tab further down in the gmb.GMB_mainTable.
			For example, one can have entries stored in the
			following order in gmb.GMB_mainTable: 'Mabellina', 'McDonald',
			'Muster', where both 'Mabellina' and 'Muster' must
			belong to the letter tab 'M' whereas 'McDonald' 
			belongs to letter tab 'MC'.  When these entries are
			being displayed, all of the entries in tab 'M' must
			be displayed before the ones in 'MC'.
			Hence, we have to keep checking the next entries until
			one of the folloing conditions is met:

			1. End of database - this means that there are no more
			entries that belong to the main set, i.e. 'M'.  So
			find the 1st entry in the subset ('MC') and display it.
			2. Beginning of a new main set, i.e. any letter 
			other than 'M' - this means same as the case 1 above
			do the same thing.
			3. Entry that belongs to the main set (i.e., 'M')
			Display this record.

		JFH - this is all out the window since I'm just doing single
			letter tabs... AND... I'm not yet sure why all this is
			necessary if the records are saved in index order???????
			If not changing tabs it works fine - so let's see what
			happens if we treat the changing tabs the same way...
			One reason for all this rigamarole would be that the subset
			records are stored in normal order so in the M vs Mc scenario
			you'd have to go thru the database to pull those out and
			display them.  Anyway - we'll just do a straight next record
			thing - at least for now.
