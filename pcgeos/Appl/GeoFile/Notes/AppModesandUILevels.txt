DESCRIPTION:
	This document will endeavor to explain the necessary and sufficient
	conditions needed when dealing with GeoFile's application modes,
	layout mode types, and user interface levels.

I.	Synopsis

	GeoFile is unique with it's various application modalities.  Since
	the 'standard' User Interface Level handling code cannot cope with
	this situation all by itself, GeoFile has it's own mode setting
	functionality. The following sections will explain the steps
	that must be performed when various modifications are desired.


II.	Normal UI Objects

	The actions are, of course, merely additions to any other tasks
	that need to be performed upon the object for other reasons.
	Remeber that a fair number of objects are added to the application
	at application opening time so just looking through uiMain will
	burn you.

	A.	Adding Normal UI Objects

		Add a table entry to the GFUIChangeTable in
		Main/mainModes.goc for the object.  Specify: the
		application mode(s) (Data Entry/Design) in which the the
		object is to be usable, the layout mode(s) in which the
		object should be enabled, the user interface levels at
		which the object should be usable, and which user interface
		levels feature that the object should be controlled with
		(e.g., usable if the feature is on).  See section IV for
		more information on each of these areas.

	B.	Modifying Normal UI Objects

		Modify the object's GFUIChangeTable entry as per the
		specifications under (A) above.

	C.	Deleting Normal UI Objects

		Delete the object's GFUIChangeTable entry.


III.	UI Controllers

	The actions are, of course, merely additions to any other tasks
	that need to be performed upon the object for other reasons.
	Remeber that a fair number of objects (especially controllers) are
	added to the application at application opening time so just
	looking through uiMain will burn you.

	A.	Adding UI Controllers

		Follow the instructions for adding a normal UI object.  If
		the controller needs to be recalculated/restarted/etc.
		based a given user interface level feature then add table
		entries for the object in the sub-tables of the
		usabilityTable in Main/mainApplication.goc for the features
		that should cause the re-[whatever].  If the controller
		needs to be recalculated/restared/etc. based on the a
		change of the current user interface level then add a table
		entry for the object in the levelsTable.

	B.	Modifying UI Controllers

		Follow the instructions for modifying a normal UI object.
		Modify (if necessary) any table entries for the object in
		the sub-tables of the usabilityTable as appropriate.
		Modify (if necessary) the table entry (if any) for the
		object in the levelsTable.

	C.	Deleting UI Controllers

		Follow the instructions for deleting a normal UI object.
		Delete any table entries for the object in the sub-tables
		of the usabilityTable.  Delete the entry in the
		levelsTable, if any.


IV.	Specifiers

	A.	User Interface Features

		1.	Adding UI Features

			Add a constant to the GeoFileUserLevelsFeatures
			list (if there is room for any new ones :-).  You
			may want to try to keep the the features in some
			kind of relative ordering (i.e., the features that
			are available at lower levels are nearer to the top
			of the list and the more advanced features are
			closer to the bottom).
			Figure out which UI Levels the feature should be a
			part of and modify the UI levels constants
			accordingly.
			Add an entry in the FeaturesList boolean group
			which corresponds to the given feature.

		2.	Deleting UI Features

			Delete the entry from the FeaturesList boolean group
			which corresponds to the given feature.
			Remove all of the feature constant's use and
			definition.  You may need to consolidate the
			remaining GeoFileLevelsFeatures constants.

	B.	GeoFile Application Modes

		1.	Adding Application Modes

			Create a new equivalent definition for GFUIModes
			(in mainModes.goc).  Check to make sure that the
			old definitions are still valid and make and
			changes that are necessary.
			Go through the GFUIChangeTable and make any changes
			necessary.

		2.	Deleting Application Modes

			Delete all uses of the GFUIModes mode constant and
			it's definition.  Check to make sure that the
			remaining defintions are still valid and make and
			consolidations/modifications necessary.

	C.	Layout Mode Types

		1.	Adding Layout Mode Types

			Follow the instructions for adding an application
			mode, substituting GFUILayoutTypes for GFUIModes.

		2.	Deleting Layout Mode Types

			Follow the instructions for deleting an application
			mode, substituting GFUILayoutTypes for GFUIModes.
