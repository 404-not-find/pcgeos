;from the raw "auxBuf" buffer that is filled by the device driver.

inputHead	dw 	(?)	;offset into dgroup to the end of the current
				;line in the [inputLine] buffer. This pointer
				;is used to append characters to the line.

;flags related to the [inputLine] buffer:

resetInput	db	(?)	;TRUE when [inputLine] contains an entire
				;line of text, which can be discarded once
				;it is compared to [matchTable].

checkInputLineForMatch db (?)	;TRUE when [inputLine] contains an entire line,
				;or when it contains the first 128 chars of
				;a very long line. We want to compare the
				;inputLine buffer against the match table.

inputLineTooLong db	(?)	;TRUE when we scanned a portion of a very long
				;line into [inputLine], filling that buffer up.
				;This flag indicates that we want to continue
				;scanning input until we get a CR, without
				;checking for matches.

;misc flags:

restartFlag	db	(?)	;TRUE when we find a match in the matchTable,
				;and want to restart the script at the
				;"GOTO foo" text which is pointed to by the
				;match string.


;misc variables:
