scriptGoals:
see also [ scriptContents ]

The script module provides routines which allow the user to write scripts
using macro primatives which will allow the user to automate his logon
process when using commercial information services.

scriptRoutines:

scriptInternal:

Primatives needed are

;Lines starting with a ';' are comment lines.
:LABEL					- lines starting with ':' are labels

BELL					- make a 'beep' sound

COMM				- set communication settings
		<BAUD-DATABITS-PARITY-STOPBITS-DUPLEX>
		COMM	1200-8-N-1-FULL

DIAL 		<str exp>		- tone dial this number	
		DIAL	6420071		- 	automatically prepends the
						ATD(T,P) prefix as well as 
						appends the CR.

END					- stop interpreting script

GOTO		<label> 		- goto to this label

MATCH		<str exp> 		- look for this string
						(add string to match table)
PAUSE		<num_con>		- pause this amount of time

PULSE 					- pulse dial	

PORT		<num_con>		- what com port to use

PRINT		<str_exp>		- print to the screen

PROMPT		<num_con>		- max time to wait for match strings
					
SEND		<str exp>		- send out this string
	.	SEND	FOO,CR 		- sends string followed by CR
	.	SEND	FOO,^M 		- sends string followed by CR

TERM		<str_exp>		- terminal type to emulate
		<TTY, VT52, VT100...>

scriptNotes:

ScriptRunFile
	FileRead (script file)
	Switch input to go to ScriptInput routine
	InterpretScript (file buffer) 

InterpretScript
	Get token (data separated by whitespace)
	if first char of token is ";"
		this is comment line, ignore it
		skip to next line
	if first char of token is ":"
		this is label, ignore it
		skip to next line;
	DoCommand (ds:si -> token)
	Set Script state/current command
		search Macro table for token
		if token found (pass ptr to rest of line to command)

Each command does its own thing
	each command interprets the line and checks for correct # of arguments
	(returns file ptr to start of next line)

Commands broken into two types, immediate and delayed.

Immediate commands can be completed immediately
	PORT, COMM, TTY, DIAL, TYPE, GOTO, PAUSE, BELL

Delayed commands need tables to be set up and state to be saved.
	PROMPT, MATCH
