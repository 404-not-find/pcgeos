DESCRIPTION:
	This file contains the resource DisplayUI that contains a 
	GenDisplay object and a GenView object which are duplicated 
	for each BDocument object instantiated.
	After instantiating the BDocument object, the GenDocumentGroup will
	duplicate the resource containing BDisplay and add the display as
	a generic child of BDisplayGroup, then make the BDocument object be
	the content for the duplicated BView.
