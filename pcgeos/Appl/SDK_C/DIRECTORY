AppIcon/
	Shows how to have several monikers for the spui to choose
	from so the best possible moniker will be displayed.

Benoit/
	This monster sample application should not be included with
	any SDK until it is updated. It requires the MSet library in
	LIBRARY\SDK_C\MSET. There are compilation problems with this
	sample, too, so you'll need to fix those as well.

ChunkArr/
	Sample to show how to use ChunkArrays.

ClipSamp/
	Demonstrates how to manipulate the clipboard to transfer text
	scraps, using both quick- and normal-transfer. Also includes the 
	use and maintenance of a GenEditControl object, along with a
	discussion of controllers in general.

CustGeom/
	Shows various evil ways of defeating the geometry manager via
	position attributes and hints.	It has no code, just UI objects.

DBSamp/
	Shows how to use the Database library.

Dictionary/
	I think this shows how to access the dictionary in Ensemble.
	If that is true, it's not useful for any other devices we've
	been doing.

	Document control samples...

Document/ProcView/
	Document control sample, procedural model, document drawn in
	view/content.

Document/DefDoc/
	Sample document control using a default document.

ECheck/
	An example based off of the Tutorial sample that shows how you
	can go nuts with error-checking code. Good because not enough
	of the samples use EC code.

FP2Asc/
	Converts floating point numbers to ASCII.

FSFilter/
	A sample app that demonstrates some of the filtering abilities of the
	GenFileSelector object.

	A sample of creating graphics using GString opcodes.

GStest3/
	Builds on the GStest with examples of bitmap graphics.

GenAttrs/
	An example of setting various generic attributes, such as usable,
	enabled, initiate busy state, input hold up, and input ignore.

GenInter/
	Examples of GenInteraction usage (sub-groups, popups and dialogs).
	Also shows how to UserDoDialog and UserStandardDialog.
	Pressing "New" in the file menu will bring up a Yes/No style modal
	dialog box.  Pressing "Revert" will bring up an OK style modal dialog
	box.  Pressing "Open", "Use Template", "Close" and "Save"  will bring
	up various UserStandardDialog dialogs.

GenItemG/
	Shows how to use the GenItemGroupClass and GenBooleanGroupClass.

GenTree/
	An example of how to add one generic object or a group of generic
	objects to primary or a menu while running.

Glyph/
	Shows a simple example of a GenGlyphDisplay object.


GrObj/DupGrObj
	Shows a slightly less than simple example of the Graphic object.  
	Uses the graphic object, vitrual memory, and multiple documents.
	Allows the user to draw rectanglular graphic objects in multiple 
	views.

Hello/
	The basic sample application, which shows an application drawing
	rotated text inside a view.

Hello2/
	Features include changing the text, changing the color and
	rotation of the text.

Hello3/
	The Hello application modified as follows:  Text changed to
	"Welcome to PC/GEOS!"  Color changing added:  Menu has "Color"
	item that brings up dialog with "Blue" and "Gold" triggers
	that change the text color and redraw the window.

Help/HelpSamp/
	Shows how to add help contexts to interactions in your app, in
	order to get context sensitive help.

Help/HelpTrig/
	Shows how to do stuff with the Help triggers. Not good under
	Zoomer, OmniGo, or N9000 since they don't have help triggers
	in the windows anymore (now use hard icons).

Help/HelpView/
	A sample that allows viewing of help files.

IACP/Client1/
IACP/Client2/
IACP/Server/
	Sample that shows how to use IACP as a form on communication
	between applications. Basically the clients do things to the
	server, such as make it quit.

InkTest/
	Demonstrates use of the ink object and library, specifically
	the inkfix library.

IrFaxMod/
	This isn't part of Release20X, it was a mistake for this to be
	installed here.

Launch/
	Shows how to make another application launch itself. It uses
	both the IACP method and the UserLoadApplication. It uses
	GeodeFind and FileEnum to perform this, so demonstrates those
	functions as well.

Levels/
	A sample that has several "user levels". Only useful on the
	Ensemble product since no other devices support user levels.

Mailbox/
	This isn't part of Release20X, it was a mistake for this to be
	installed here.

Moniker/
	Does all kinds of neat moniker related stuff, such as having
	different kinds of monikers, changing the monikers, etc.

MultPrim/
	This sample has two primary windows. Good for the Ensemble product
	since other devices don't support multiple windows.

	as for managing the smaller screen and dealing with floating
	keyboards.

PSCText/
	Shows how to have a text controller interact with a text object.

ParaAttr/
	Illustrates the use of paragraph attributes in a text object.

Parser/

Print/
	Allows printing of text from a VisLargeText object; even handles
	printing across multiple pages.

Rulers/
	Demonstrates the use of ruler objects when connected to a view
	that is smaller than the content being displayed.

Serial2/
	Samples that show how to use the serial port via the Serial
	and StreamC geodes.

SimpInk/
	An empty directory, how exciting.

SimpWP/
	A simple word processor to illustrate some basic concepts.

SubUI/
	Shows how to subclass generic objects and add behavior to them.

Talk/
	This is not part of Releas20X and shouldn't be here.

Template/
	Just the basic outline of a GEOS application. Used to write new
	sample applications.

TextInk/
	Demonstrates the simple use of combining ink and text objects.

TicTac/
	A simple example of VisClass objects intercepting mouse events so
	the user can drag them around the screen.  It's somewhat akin to
	the old "House" application; it's a Tic Tac Toe board and ten
	pieces that the user can place on the board (or anywhere else).

TriggerData/
	Not yet installed, shows some examples of how to pass data in trigger
	actions.

Tutorial/mchrt1/
Tutorial/mchrt2/
Tutorial/mchrt3/
Tutorial/mchrt4/
	Used in the Tutorial techdoc to show the steps in creating a full
	application (not just this little stuff!). If changes are made
	you should notify the "techdocs" group.

TwoDLists/
	Shows how to have two dynamic lists and remove items from one
	and put them in the other.

UICtrl/
	Example of a controller object (subclassing GenControl).  Uses the
	text object.  The sample cotroller generates a text style menu.

VLText/
	Demonstrates the use of a VisLargeText object.

VarData/
	A simple example for adding and removing vardata elements from an
	object while it is up on screen.  This example shows how to add and
	remove geometry hints from two different GenInteractions.

View/GenContent/
	An example of various generic objects running under a GenContent
	object.  It runs OK, although there seem to have been bugs
	introduced recently.

View/ScaleToFit/
	This view sample shows (unspectacularly) how to set up a view to
	scale to content to fit whatever size the view is.

View/SplitView/
	This example doesn't really show how to split views, but rather shows
	how to set up four views in a window, and have them linked together
	so that one set of right-placed and bottom-placed scrollbars will 
	scroll them together.  It also shows how to scroll one view without
	scrolling the others as well, although this would be unusual for
	linked views.

View/ViewSamp/
	A simple example of how to set up a view, showing ways to send
	messages to it to scroll or scale its contents.

Vis/VisSamp/
	An example of a VisContent object with custom visual objects
	underneath it. This example shows how to add and remove different
	items, switching between using the geometry manager and custom
	dynamic positioning of the children, and other miscellanious stuff.

Vis/VisSamp2/
	An example of a VisContent object with custom visual objects underneath
	it.  This example shows how to have the bounds of all the objects
	under the VisContent be set up in the .goc file.

Vis/VisSamp3/
	An example of a VisContent object with custom visual objects underneath
	it.  This example shows how to use the geometry manager to manage the
	children, centering and full-justifying them while the content follows
	the size of the view.

Vis/VisSamp4/
	An example of a VisContent object with custom visual objects underneath
	it.  This example shows how to add items in the visual world, and how
	to have the view switch between different VisContent objects.

Wavsamp/
	Works only on the zoomer (because it requires the wav library).
	Demonstrates PlaySoundFromFile and WavPlayFile, and why you don't
	really want to call PlaySoundFromFile in the UI thread.
