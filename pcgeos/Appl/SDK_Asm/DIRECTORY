    If he used it before the new filesystem came on-line, his .ini file may
    have an old form of data recording the default document to use. he should
    look for a [defdoc] category (I believe that's it) and biff the whole thing
    from his .ini file.

TwoDLists/
	There are no methods so the app does not do anything. Looks like it
	was never finished. Look at SDK_C/TwoDList which is finished.

UICtrl/
	Example of a controller object (subclassing GenControl).  Uses the
	text object.  The sample cotroller generates a text style menu.

Yoda/
	Moved to SDK_Asm/no_go because it tries to include non-existent
	.def files. Maybe it has never been converted to 2.0.

I moved the following apps to the no_go directory which means we are NOT
shipping them on the PC SDK. Some of them don't work and some include 
internal .def files. 		20 Dec 93 -Tom Lester

Sample apps we are NOT shipping on the PC SDK:
----------------------------------------------
-no_go/SDK_Asm/Express		looks a little weird
				needs Internal/threadIn.def
-no_go/SDK_Asm/GenDList		crash on open
-no_go/SDK_Asm/GenItemGroup	doesn't work
-no_go/SDK_Asm/GrObj/InstGrObj	crashes
-no_go/SDK_Asm/Item		crash on exit
-no_go/SDK_Asm/LargeVisTree	V1.0 stuff
-no_go/SDK_Asm/SndPlay 		needs Internal/soundFmt.def
				needs Internal/semInt.def
-no_go/SDK_Asm/Talk		looks ok
				I did not actually test it 
				needs Internal/serialDr.def
				needs Internal/netDr.def
				needs Internal/streamDr.def
				needs Internal/socketID.def
-no_go/SDK_Asm/ToolSamp		crashes on open
-no_go/SDK_Asm/TwoDLists	not finished
-no_go/SDK_Asm/ViewSamp1	needs a little work
-no_go/SDK_Asm/ViewSamp2	needs a little work
-no_go/SDK_Asm/VisDoc		crashes on open
-no_go/SDK_Asm/Yoda		V1.0 stuff
