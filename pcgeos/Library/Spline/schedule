GRATUITOUS COOL

Create splines using "scribble" mode: 		5-15 days 



TO DO WHEN I GET BACK FROM POINTS EAST:

Code review 

Further break up the SplineCode segment (presently about 5600 bytes
EC) -- I will probably create 2 new segments: SplineDragSelectCode and
SplinePtrCode.

Jon And Steve will probably have change requirements re:  adding
VisSpline to their respective projects.

Clip the VisSpline to its Vis boundaries.

Add the left-mouse-button double-click and close-the-curve
functionality.

Finish UNDO stuff (yes, I said it was finished before, so sue me!)

Look over the ScratchData structure/routines.  Decide if this stuff
should all go in the instance data itself?  

Also, I can eliminate the "OperateLocalVars" stack frame if I use the
ScratchData chunk instead.  Pros/Cons?

Change everything back to using es:bp - pointer to VSI instance data,
and keep the chunk handle in the scratch chunk.   This would benefit
99% of my code and harm 1%.

Rewrite the entire library in Lisp, and write a lisp interpreter for GEOS.

Figure out inval/draw strategies re:  deleting and inserting points.
(ie, minimal invalidations, etc).

If a point is already selected, and user presses START_SELECT on it, then
don't unselect other points.


When moving multiple auto-smooth anchors, update CONTROLS AFTER all
ANCHORS have been updated.
