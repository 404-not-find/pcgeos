Clean up ImpexCleanUpSummons and ImpexDetachComplete - n.b. use of bp
(mainImpex.asm)

In mainThread.asm, ImpexThreadListSearchForAppEntry has the *same*
comments as ImpexThreadListSearchForThreadEntry. Fix!

Fix and finish handling of errors in the loading and processing of
translation libraries. The relevant routines are - in
uiImpexGadgets.asm - ImpexFormatEnum, ImpexProcessLibrary, and
ImpexLoadExtendedInfo, and, - in uiImpexLibraryList.asm -
IFLSpecBuild and IFLSpecBuildError. Read the BUGS sections at the
beginning of the three routines in uiImpexGadgets.asm.

Impex needs to check whether the data classes have been reset before
just bringing up an already-built export or import summons. The
relevant routines are ImpexInitiateImport and ImpexInitiateExport,
both in uiImpex.asm.
