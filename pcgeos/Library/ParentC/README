
ParentalControlClass:
To bring up dialog boxes from the parental control, 
you first subclass ParentalControlClass, then calls one of the following
methods to bring up the dialog box you want:


MSG_PC_BRING_UP_WEBSITE_DB
 If passed cx == PC_ON, bring up the 'Set Password' dialog box
 If passed cx == PC_OFF, bring up a 'Enter Password' dialog box for
   authentication.

MSG_PC_BRING_UP_WEBSITE_DB
 Bring up the "Permissble WWW Sites" dialog box.  This dialog box
 allows users to Add/Modify/Delete web sites from database that the 
 browser refers to for allowable sites.

MSG_PC_CHECK_PASSWORD_DB
 Called by other applications, like news reader,
 which wish to check user's authentication.
 Other app can call this method like the following:

	CheckPassWordTrigger = GenTriggeor {
	    moniker = 'P', "Check Password";
	    action = MSG_PC_CHECK_PASSWORD_DB, ParentControlWebSiteRoot;
	    hints = {
		ATTR_GEN_TRIGGER_ACTION_DATA {
		    byte    PC_NEWSGROUP     /* show newsgroup text in db */
		}
	    }
	}
 The other possible value for ATTR_GEN_TRIGGER_ACTION_DATA is 
 PC_EMAIL.  If Other application wants to bring up this password dialog 
 box too, then the programmer needs to add another value for 
 ATTR_GEN_TRIGGER_ACTION_DATA, add another text string for the dialog box, 
 and add a comparision code in the ChangeDialogTitle.



What these methods do are
(1) Duplicate the resource segment of the dialog box that we wants to 
    bring up.
(2) Append the top root dialog in the duplicated resource to the controller 
    object from the calling application (or another library module),
    set the root dialog usable.
(3) call UserDoDialog, to bring up the dialog box on screen.
(4) Process the response from the user's interaction with the dialog box.
(5) Destroy the duplicated resource block
(6) Return the user interaction flag: IC_OK, IC_CANCEL


There are other methods in ParentalControlClass, but they are internal 
methods.
