Synopsis
--------
The UI implements a general mechanism, called "faces", to allow the
environment and applications to be easily customized to the experience
level of the user.  This document describes both this general
mechanism and the environment level support for it.

Limitations
-----------
It does not exist yet :)

Alternatives
------------
Roll your own and face the wrath of Doug :)

Implementation Status
---------------------
A gleam in our eyes

	Description -- General
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Terminology
-----------
faces:
	- The collection of mechanisms, both in the UI and in
	  applications, that implement the scalable user interface.

face:
	- A named collection of interface settings

interface setting (or just "setting"):
	- A single user-changable feature in the user interface, such
	as "directory model".  Interface settings are normally stored
	in the geos.ini file.

option:
	- A single state for an interface setting.  Each interface
	  setting has two or more options, only one of which can be
	  selected at any one time.

The UI implements environment interface settings, described below.

NOTE: Names with dashes instead of spaces (such as Look-At-Me)
      indicate no reasonable name has been figured out.

		High Level Modes
		================

Interface Setting: Environment Access
-------------------------------------
Description:
	This setting determines how the environment controls (such as
	switching apps, launching apps, changing faces, ...) are
	accessed.  Note that unlike most settings, this one is
	somewhat dependent on the hardware available.
Options:
    * Hard Icon Area
	On machines that have hard-wired icons, this option allows
	these hard icons to be used.

    * System Bar
	This option places an always visible bar of UI components
	against one side of the screen.  This bar allows access to the
	environment controls.

    * Express Menu
	This option places a button in the window header of the top
	application that leads to a menu that allows access to the
	environment controls.

Interface Setting: Directory Model
----------------------------------
Description:
	This setting determines how the file system is	presented to
	the user.
Options:
    * One Level
	This option presents the user with a flat directory structure
	(all documents go in the DOCUMENT directory).

    * GEOS Tree
	This option allows the user to navigate directories in the
	file selector, but only below the document directory and on
	floppy disks.

    * Full Access
	This option gives the user full access to the file system.

Interface Setting: Window Model
-------------------------------
Description:
	This setting determines how overlapping windows are used in
	the user interface.
Options:
    * Full Screen
	This option causes all application windows and display windows
	to be full-sized.   The user is given no way of overlapping
	windows.

    * Overlapping
	This option causes all application and display windows to be
	movable and resizable.

	Default Full Screen Apps

Interface Setting: Application Model
------------------------------------
Description:
	This setting determines how applications are presented to the
	user and how the launcher acts when applications are started.
Options:
    NOTE: For any option, double-clicking on a document that is
	  already open brings the app with the document open to the
	  front.

    * Transparent
	This option hides the distinction between a running
	application and a non-running application.

	Only one instance of any application may be running.

	Application windows are full screen (except for those marked
	as Desk Accessories, which float on top, & would not be
	managed transparently, i.e. would have to stay in memory until
	exited))

	The Express menu is really just a "startup" or "switch to" menu

    * User Controlled
	The Express menu allows switching between currently running
	applications

	Application windows are movable & resizable (Whether apps come
	up maximized more not by default is a separately settable
	option)

	* Single instance per application
	    Single instance limit on given application.  If an
	    application or document is double-clicked on, and an
	    instance of the application is already running, that
	    instance would be brought to the top (and any document
	    opened/switched to within it, depending on the document
	    model)

	* Multiple instances available
	    If an application or document double-clicked on, and an
	    instance of the application is already running, a dialog
	    would come up asking if one of the already running
	    applications should be used, or whether a new instance
	    should be created.

	*"Power" multiple instances
	    Like V1.2

Interface Setting: Document Model
---------------------------------
Description:
	This setting determines how documents are presented to the
	user.
Options:
    * Transparent
	This option hides the distinction between an open document and
	a closed document.

	The document control only puts one item in the File menu for
	opening, closing and switching documents, "Switch Documents"

	When the user chooses "Switch Documents" (and when an
	application is launched) a dialog box comes up with icons
	and descriptions for:
		* New Empty -- Create an empty document
		* New -- Use a template to create a new document
		* Import -- Import a document from a different format
		* Open -- Open an existing document
		* Quit -- Leave the application

	When the user creates a new document a name must be given for
	it.

	The user is never prompted for "Do you want to save changes?",
	since (from the user's standpoint) changes are always saved.

    * Multiple Documents
	This option allows the user to have multiple documents open

	This causes the document control to replace "Switch Documents"
	with "New", "Open" and "Close".

		Lower Level Settings
		====================

Interface Setting: Default Full Screen Apps
-------------------------------------------
Description:
	This setting causes applications to launch maximized by
	default.  This setting is ignored if the Window Model is Full
	Size.
Options:
	On, Off

	Window Model

Interface Setting: Floating Desk Accessories
--------------------------------------------
        "Floating":     If set, app when launched will be non-maximzed
                        (regardless of application windows mode) & will appear
                        on top.  This will likley need to be settable, as the
                        idea of what makes a good "desk accessory" will likely
                        vary by screen size & user orientation.

        Question:       Where in the heck should this option appear?
