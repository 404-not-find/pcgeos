Spooler Stuff
============
	* PaperSizes are no longer globally accesible. Application
	  should no longer to use these enumerated types

	* There are now three types of "pages" - paper, envelopes,
	  and labels. There is code to allow users to define new
	  sizes of each of these (up to 128 user-defined sizes),
	  and to defined the order in which these sizes appear
	  inside of dialog boxes (like the PrintControl or PageSetup)

	* The SpoolPrintControlClass has been renamed to the
	  PrintControlClass, and is now subclassed off of GenControl.
	  All message names have been changed to MSG_PRINT_CONTROL_blah,
	  and some of the parameters to these messages have changed.
	  Please check spool.def for full details.

	* Brief summary of PrintControl changes:
		- No more app-defined methods. MetaPrintMessages are
		  defined for verifying, printing, notification of
	     	  dialog box on/off screen, and setting of the
	   	  document name.

		- The progress reporting mechanism is now functional.
		  See MSG_PRINT_CONTROL_REPORT_PROGRESS

		- No more form-feed flags. GrNewPage will *soon* take
		  a flag indicating whether or not a form feed should
		  occur at the end of that page.

		- 32-bit document sizes are now supported.

		- Misc other goodies. Note that the UI for the
		  PrintControl is rather ugly at the moment, as I
		  await changes to be made to the GenList & GenRange.
		  Things will become fully functional at some point
		  in the future, but you can't print now anyways, so
		  who cares? :)

	* The PageSizeListClass is gone. In its place are two new
	  controllers:
		PageSizeControlClass, which is essentially for
			internal spooler use only.

		PageSetupControlClass, which applications should
			use for their PageSetup duties. See
			SpoolSetDocSize() for an easy way to use
			this controller.

	* The following applications have been updated to function
	  with the new PrintControl object, though no work was done
	  to optimize code using the new messages.
		- GeoCalc
		- GeoDex
		- GeoPlanner
		- PrefMgr
		- NotePad		


Other stuff
===========
	* MSG_TEXT_CALC_ONE_LINE_WDITH now actually does the right
	  thing, instead of returning the width of the first character
	  the object holds.

	* ForceRef now checks to see if the symbol is already defined,
	  and if not, does nothing

	* Installed new UIC to deal with optrComps in quotes. Syntax
	  is:

		myBlockChunk = optrComp "chunkDefinedInAsmFile"

	* I will soon be installing a new Spool Test application.

Remote Printing
===============
	In order for you application to support printing from the desktop,
	you must add vardata to your application object indicating the 
	PrintControl object to be used for this function:

                ATTR_GEN_APPLICATION_PRINT_CONTROL { UN_OPTR DrawPrintControl }

	As this data must be relocated, your application object should be 
	declared using the "vardataReloc" operator:

		DrawApp = DrawApplication vardataReloc {
		...
		}
