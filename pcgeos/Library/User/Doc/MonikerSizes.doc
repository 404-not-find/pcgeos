The standard icon sizes for PC/GEOS are:

/* Standard PC/GEOS artwork sizes */

#define	LARGE_ICON_WIDTH 64	/* Large (Welcome DOS/GCM Room) */
#define	LARGE_ICON_HEIGHT 40

#define	STANDARD_ICON_WIDTH 48	/* Standard (Desktop icons) */
#define	STANDARD_ICON_HEIGHT 30

#define	SMALL_ICON_WIDTH 30	/* Small (PDA icons) */
#define	SMALL_ICON_HEIGHT 20

#define TOOL_WIDTH 15		/* Tools in toolbar, toolboxes.  */
#define TOOL_HEIGHT 15		/* These, unlike the others, are square. */
				/* The reasoning is twofold -- one, we're */
				/* trying to fit a lot across the screen, */
				/* & second,  this size would not be used */
				/* with a name below the image, as is */
				/* normally the case with the two above. */

/* CGA-specific versions of above, to accomodate low vertical resolution  */

#define LARGE_CGA_ICON_WIDTH 64		/* Large CGA */
#define LARGE_CGA_ICON_HEIGHT 18

#define STANDARD_CGA_ICON_WIDTH 48	/* Standard CGA */
#define STANDARD_CGA_ICON_HEIGHT 14

#define SMALL_CGA_ICON_WIDTH 32		/* Small CGA */
#define SMALL_CGA_ICON_HEIGHT 10 

#define TOOL_CGA_WIDTH 15		/* Tool CGA.  Not as proportionally */
#define TOOL_CGA_HEIGHT 10		/* smaller than other sizes, but */
					/* the artists can only do so much */
					/* with so few pixels... */

Applications should always use Moniker Lists to specify icons, as Color, 
Mono & CGA styles are generally needed for any one given size.  Regarding
sizes, Large, Standard and Small should be provided for application & document
icons, though only Tool need be provided for Tools.

To clarify, as of 9/16/93:


The standard sizes for PC/GEOS icons and tools are:

style = icon
------------

Large Color:    LC      64x40 color4 normal       Welcome icons (not used)
Large Mono:     LM      64x40 gray1 normal        Welcome icons (not used)
Large CGA:      LCGA    64x18 gray1 verySquished  Welcome icons (not used)

Standard Color: SC      48x30 color4 normal       Desktop icons
Standard Mono:  SM      48x30 gray1 normal        Desktop icons
Standard CGA:   SCGA    48x14 gray1 verySquished  Desktop icons

Small Color:    YC      32x20 color4 normal       Future Color PCA icons
Small Mono:     YM      32x20 gray1 normal        Zoomer desktop icons
Small CGA:      YCGA    32x10  gray1 verySquished  "CGA" like PDA icons (We
                                                  have no platforms using this
                                                  as of yet, and may never
                                                  have)

style = tool
------------

Tool Color:     TC      15x15 color4 normal             Destop, Zoomer tool
Tool Mono:      TM      15x15 gray1 normal              Destop, Zoomer tool
Tool CGA:       TCGA    15x10 gray1 normal              CGA tool

	  This  ^ is the abbreviation for the artwork size, & artwork of
each size is generally placed in its own resource, which is why use see 
in .gp files:

# Icons

resource AppTCMonikerResource lmem read-only shared
resource AppTMMonikerResource lmem read-only shared

A complete "Icon" insteded for all-purpose use across all platforms
could have art in 9 distinct sizes.  A Tool could have art in 3 sizes.
Applications intended to be used on both desktop & PDA's should have SC, SM,
SCGA, YC, YM for icons, and TC, TM and TCGA for tools.  The grids being used
by TonyL for artwork creation have all these sizes.  

The icon editor should offer these standards to the developer in a way that
promotes their use (i.e. these should be the default sizes offered, so that
a developer does not have to perform research or guess at what sizes they
should be providing)
