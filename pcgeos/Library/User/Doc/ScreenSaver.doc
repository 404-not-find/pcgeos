About the Screen Saver
----------------------
PC/GEOS provides built-in screen-saver logic to detect when the user has
been away from the machine for a given period of time, to turn a screen-saver
on at that time, & to turn it off when the user once again returns.
Screen Saver applications may be written to replace the default, black-screen
behavior.


Detection of User
-----------------
When screen saving is enabled, the input manager watches for the following
methods, & resets the screen-saver timer to the full time-out value whenever
one is encountered:

	METHOD_PTR_CHANGE	(which results in ptr movement)
	METHOD_BUTTON_CHANGE
	METHOD_KBD_SCAN
	METHOD_PRESSURE_CHANGE
	METHOD_DIRECTION_CHANGE

The counter is decremented each minute, & should it reach zero, the user is
assumed to be away from the station, & the screen saver is turned on.  The
moment that any of the above methods is detected, the saver is turned back
off, & the counter reset.


Mechanism, Preferences
----------------------
The Kernel defaults the screen saver to OFF, with a time-out value of 15
minutes.  The user interface, on startup, adjusts the screen saver status &
timeout based on the following keys within the [ui] category of geos.ini:

	screenBlanker		(boolean)
	screenBlankerTimeout	(integer)

If these keys are missing, the UI defaults to OFF & 15 minutes.  The On/off
status may be changed by sending either to the IM:

METHOD_IM_ENABLE_SCREEN_SAVER              method
;
;       This method is provided to enable the screen blanking support of
; the flow object.
;
;       Pass:   nothing
;       Return: nothing
;

METHOD_IM_DISABLE_SCREEN_SAVER             method
;
;       This method is provided to disable the screen blanking support of
; the flow object.
;
;       Pass:   nothing
;       Return: nothing
;

The time delay may be adjusted by sending:

METHOD_IM_GET_SCREEN_SAVER_DELAY                method
;
; This method is provided to fetch the current screen saver delay
;
;       Pass:   nothing
;       Return: ax      - count, in minutes
;

METHOD_IM_SET_SCREEN_SAVER_DELAY                method
;
; This method is provided to change the delay between the last user
; input and the screen blanking action.
;
;       Pass:   cx      - new count, in minutes, must be 2 or larger
;                         ( A time-out of 1 will blank every minute regardless
;                           of user activity)
;       Return: nothing
;


The application "Preferences", part of the GeoWorks Ensemble package, provides
a user-interface to the user for adjusting the above-mentioned geos.ini values.


Writing a screen saver
----------------------
An application may override the default black-screen behavior, or
override any active screen-saver, by sending the following:

METHOD_IM_INSTALL_SCREEN_SAVER          method
;
;       This method is provided to change the action taken when the screen
; blank delay has expired.  A new OD is passed, along with the method numbers
; to use.  When screen blank is enabled and SAVER_DELAY minutes have expired
; since the last user input, the passed message "begin method" is sent
; to the passed OD.  The method "end method" is sent when the display
; is re-enabled.  Use METHOD_IM_REMOVE_SCREEN_SAVER to remove the OD reference
; when it will no longer be available.
;
;       Pass:   cx:dx   - OD of screen saver to install
;               si      - begin method
;               bp      - end method
;
;       Return: nothing
;


The OD specified will receive the "beginMethod" indicating the saver should
be turned on, & the "endMethod" to indicate it should be shut off.

To restore default behavior (as a screen saver should do if it is exited),
send:

METHOD_IM_REMOVE_SCREEN_SAVER           method
;
;       This method is provided to change the action taken when the screen
; blank delay has expired to the default action (blank the screen).
;
;       Pass:   cx:dx   - OD of screen saver to remove
;       Return: nothing
;

Upon receipt of the "beginMethod", it is the responsibility of the screen-saver
to do something to preserve the user's video monitor, should it be left on
for hours or days.  To do this, the application should open a window the size
of the screen, placed as a high-priority child of the screen window (so as
to appear on top), & draw predominantly dark and preferably moving images to
it.  The screen window may be found by calling ImGetPtrWin.
