	Note: This list changes slightly based on the application.  This list
	      was made using geoWrite.

General
-------
* When no files are open all menu items EXCEPT File:New,Open,Exit, View, and
  Options are disabled
* New creates a new file "Write Untitled #"
* Items in file menu are enabled/disabled correctly:
	With no file open: New and Open are enabled
	With file open, no changes: New, Open, Close, Save As are enabled
	With file open, changes: New, Open, Close, Save, Save As, Revert are
				 enabled
	With read-only file open, changes: New, Open, Close, Save As, Revert
					   are enabled
* Maiking any modification to the document enables Save and Revert
* Open allows opening existing file
* Open of file that is already open gives "File In Use" dialog box
* Close of named file with no changes immediately closes the file
* Close of named file with changes gives "Save changes ?" dialog, Yes/No/Cancel
  all work correctly
* Close of unnamed file with no changes closes are deletes the file
* Close of unnamed file with changes gives "Save Changes ?" dialog, Yes brings
  up Save As box
* Save of named file saves the file, leaves Save and Revert disabled
* Save of unnamed file brings up Save As dialog box
* Save As brings up dialog box showing disks and directories but no files
* Save As saves file with a new name
* Save As with a file name that already exists gives "Do you want to
  overwrite?", answering yes overwrites, answering no brings Save As dialog
  box back up
* Save As with a file name that is open gives "File In Use" message
* Save As on to a write protected disk gives a dialog box allowing the user to
  remove the write protection or cancel.
* Revert closes all pages and reopens the first page
* Exit with no files open exits the file immediately
* Exit with files open goes closes each file with the same behavior as Close.
  Cancelling either from "Save changes ?" or from SaveAs terminates the exit.
* Opening a file "read-only" allows the file to be reverted and closed, but
  save is never enabled and close->yes maps to SaveAs.
* Opening a file that has already been opened read-only gives an error (in
  write, may be different for other apps).
* Opening a file that can only be opened read-only gives a warning.
* Opening a file on a write protected disk gives a warning and opens the
  file read-only.
* Having two instances of the application running works.
