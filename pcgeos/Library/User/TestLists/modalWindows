__ Correct behavior of mouse

	__ If the mouse is pressed and interacting with any of the following
	   when a modal window comes up, the interaction should be terminated:
	   (Testable using Simple with target of "App GenSummons", in
	   "3 second delay mode", pressing the "Action 2" menu item
	   "METHOD_GEN_INITIATE_INTERACTION" 
	   NOTE:  This area requires all gadgets to properly deal with
	   GADGET_EXCL, & particularly LOST_GADGET_EXCL
T		__ Trigger
FAILS		__ Range: arrows
T		__ Range: text
T		__ Text object
T		__ Scrolling list entries
T		__ Checkboxes
FAILS		__ Scrollbar
*****2		__ Windowed gadget (geoWrite's ruler -- use quickly after
		   changing doc & selecting file-close)
T		__ Application-run view
*****3		__ Minimize/Maximize/Restore button
T		__ System menu
T		__ Express menu
T		__ Application menu:  Being pulled down from primary
T		__ Application menu:  Pinned & being interacted with
T		__ Application submenu:  Dragged into from primary
T		__ Application submenu:  Dragged into from pinned menu
FAILS		__ Text within a view, run by UI thread (GenTextEdit object)
T		__ Dragging a window around (Summons currently cannot come up
		   until this is completed because it blocks drawing)
T		__ MDI background (Currently does nothing)

T	__ If the mouse is NOT over the modal window when it comes up, then
	   the "Modality" ptr image should be showing, & clicking should get
	   no response over any of, or dragging from a click in:
	   NOTE:  This area is implemented with one mechansim, requiring
	   only a small amount of code for each of the different windowed
	   object implementations
T		__ Primary title area
T		__ pinned menus
T		__ dialog boxes
T		__ previously active modal window
T		__ MDI background area
T		__ View area
!		__ Windowed gadget (geoWrite's ruler -- use quickly after
		   changing doc & selecting file-close)

	__ If the mouse is NOT over the modal window when it comes up, and
	   you use the kbd to bring it down (hit enter), then you should 
	   immediately be able to interact with the object below the mouse.
	   NOTE:  This area is implemented with one mechansim, requiring
	   only a small amount of code for each of the different windowed
	   object implementations
	   Try this with:
T		__ Primary title area
T		__ pinned menus
T		__ dialog boxes
T		__ underlying app-modal window, from app-modal window
T		__ underlying app-modal window, from sys-modal window
T		__ underlying sys-modal window, from sys-modal window
T		__ MDI background area
T		__ View area
!		__ Windowed gadget (geoWrite's ruler -- use quickly after
		   changing doc & selecting file-close)

T	__ If the mouse IS over the modal window when it comes up, you should
	   be able to interact with it, but not anything outside of it.  The
	   ptr image should change back and forth from arrow to modality symbol
	   as is appropriate.

T	__ If the mouse IS over the modal window when the modal window goes
	   away, you should immediately be able to interact with:
T		__ Primary title area
T		__ pinned menus
T		__ dialog boxes
T		__ underlying app-modal window, from app-modal window
T		__ underlying app-modal window, from sys-modal window
T		__ underlying sys-modal window, from sys-modal window
T		__ MDI background area
T		__ View area
!		__ Windowed gadget (geoWrite's ruler -- use quickly after
		   changing doc & selecting file-close)


__ Correct movement of focus

T	__ Focus should be on modal dialog when it comes up
	__ Focus should restore to where it was when it goes away.  Try with:
		__ Focus in various gadgets in underlying modal dialog box
FAILS		__ Focus in various gadgets in non-modal dialog box
T		__ Focus in display
	__ Whenever a system modal dialog box is brought up, no application
	   should appear to have the focus.  When it goes away, whichever app
	   had it before should be restored.


__ Correct behavior of keyboard

T	__ Mnemonic navigation of main menu bar should be off when modal window
	   is up
T	__ Mnemonic navigation should work inside modal window
T	__ App Global shorcuts should not work when modal window is up
	__ You shouldn't be able to navigation to a different window of app
	   while modal window is up  (MOTIF: ???)
FAILS	__ You SHOULD be able to navigate to a different application, while
	   an APPLICATION modal window is up (MOTIF:  Alt-ESC)
T	__ Try using kbd navigation only to move through Simple's 
	   "Windows & Misc" "UserDoDialog Summons.." (app & sys-modal windows)
T	__ Hitting mnemonic chars to bring up summons which is directly in
	   a menu, followed by RETURN should cause the default action to
	   happen  (Note -- if method sent off to APP thread first, this
	   won't work -- perhaps this can be revised upon implementation of
	   "Hold up input" stuff.  Also -- it would be ideal if the box didn't
	   even draw...

__ Window layering

T	__ Modal windows should always appear in front of other windows
	__ System modal windows should appear on top of screen, even if app
	   is in a different field

LEGEND

!	Interesting case -- be sure to test
T:	Tested successfully
FAILS:	Just that -- fails the test specified

*****2:	pick up a tab, & the ptr image won't change back to ptr when modal
	window comes up.
*****3: Stays depressed when modal win comes up
