* Interactive Handle Display During Marquee Selection
	
	During each PTR event two tasks must be accomplished.
		1. Erase the handles of any objects that drew their
		   handles during the last PTR event
		2. Draw the handles of any objects that are inside
		   the current marquee rectangle

	We wish to send only one message per object and send messages 
	to as few objects as possible. The set of objects we must 
	operate on is formed from the union of the two sets described by
	tasks 1 and 2. Objects in set 2 can be easily determined by
	using ObjCompProcessChildren and comparing the visual bounds of
	objects with the bounds of the marquee. To keep track of set 1,
	there is a bit in each object's state flags: OSF_TEMP_HANDLES.
	The bit is set by messages such as MSG_O_DRAW_HANDLES_OPPOSITE,
	to signify that the state of the handles has been temporarily
	modified.

	The GraphicBody exports the handler 
	MSG_GRUP_PROCESS_CHILDREN_IN_RECT. The messages expects the
	32 bounds of a rectangle and two message numbers. One message
	is for sending to objects that have their OSF_TEMP_HANDLES
	bit set. The other message is for sending to objects which fall 
	within the bounds of the passed rectangle. For objects that meet
	both conditions, another parameter specifies whether to send
	both messages or neither.
	
	For example, during the PTR event of a normal drag selection
	the pointer tool calls MSG_GRUP_PROCESS_CHILDREN_IN_RECT with
			Marquee bounds
			MSG_O_UNDRAW_HANDLES
			MSG_O_DRAW_HANDLES_FORCE
			CIRS_XOR_CHECK

	The UNDRAW message will be sent to OSF_TEMP_HANDLES objects
	to erase their handles. The FORCE message will be sent to
	objects inside the Marquee bounds, to force them to draw
	their handles regardless of their selected bit. The 
	CIRS_XOR_CHECK tells the GRUP handler to send neither message
	if the object is both inside the bounds and has its TEMP_HANDLES
	bit set. This object already has its handles drawn and we wish
	the handles to remain drawn, so nothing is exactly what we want
	done.


	Note: The OSF_TEMP_HANDLES bit is cleared by MSG_O_DRAW_HANDLES
	and MSG_O_UNDRAW_HANDLES.


* What do the ObjectStateFlags really mean?

	OSF_ACTION_ACTIVATED 
		Object is waiting for a START_SELECT or similar message. 

		For MOVE, RESIZE and ROTATE actions, the ACTIVATED period
		is non-existent, as the pointer tool jump starts these
		actions. 
		
		For CREATE, the ACTIVATED period persists from
		when the object is instantiated (user selects tool) to
		when the user clicks on the document to start creating
		the object. In this state, none of the objects 
		transformation, position, mapped corners or area/line
		attributes instance data is valid.


	OSF_ACTION_PENDING
		Object is waiting for a drag event. 

		For MOVE, CREATE, RESIZE and ROTATE actions, 
		the PENDING period is non-existent, as the pointer tool 
		jump starts these actions.

*******************************************************
* Important things to know
  	The body block can never be discarded

* Floater notes
	Floater can only exist if there is both a current body
	and a current tool. If the current body is cleared
	the floater is destroyed.
