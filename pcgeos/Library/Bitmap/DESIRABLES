*	Multiple select regions that maintain their relative positions.

*	"Playback" undo feature, wherein the user can step through the last
	edit buffer rather than taking it on an all-or-none basis.

* Limit edits to inside/outside the selected region. I mean:

	* If there is a selected region, and the user picks up some
	  editing tool (say, the pencil tool) and begins drawing inside
	  the selected region, then the pencil marks would be restricted to
	  lie within the selected region.

	* Conversely, if there is a selected region and the user starts making
	  edits outside of that region, the selected region would be protected
	  against the edits.

  I suppose this could be done by keeping the selected region stored as a
  separate bitmap (will probably be done anyway).

* Spline tool
