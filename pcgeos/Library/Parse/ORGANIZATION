The files in this directory are organized as follows:

README	- General information about the parser library.

GRAMMAR	- Definition of the grammar understood by the parser.

THOUGHTS - Lots of random thoughts about how the scanner, parser, and
	   evaluator all work. A good place to look if you want to
	   understand what I was thinking when I wrote this.


parseManager.asm	- The manager file just includes all other files.
parse.gp		- Definition file.

parseConstants.def	- Constants and other definitions.
parseMacros.def		- Macros.

parseMain.asm		- Library entry code. That's it. Nothing special.
parseVariables.asm	- Variables and tables.
parseEC.asm		- Error checking code for this library.

parseScanner.asm	- Scanner code. The entire scanner is located in
			  this file.

parseParse.asm		- Parser code.
parseWrite.asm		- Code to write out parser tokens.

parseEval.asm		- Evaluation code.
parseOperators.asm	- Implementation of the operators.
parseFunctions.asm	- Implementation of built-in functions.

parseFormat.asm		- Format a stream of parser tokens into a string.

parseError.asm		- Code to return standard error messages.

parseDepend.asm		- Code to generate dependency lists.

lib/scan.tcl		- Tcl code to help debug the scanner.
lib/parse.tcl		- Tcl code to help debug the parser.
lib/eval.tcl		- Tcl code to help debug the evaluator.
lib/pseutils.tcl	- Utilities used by scan/parse/eval.tcl.
