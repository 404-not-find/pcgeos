;		Standard One Note Song Definition
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	;
	;  To play a single note is more complex then one
	;  would like.  You can't just grab a voice and go with
	;  it - someone else may come along and grab it back.
	;  Basically, it boils down to everything requiring
	;  almost the full workings of a simple sound.  So, that
	;  is exactly what we treat a note like.  We allocate
	;  a sound structure and give it a song that plays a note,
	;  then turns it off.
