; This constant, when passed to the routine DBAlloc() will cause the
; allocation to occur in one of (potentially) many the database files
; locally managed groups. The group in which the item is allocated is
; returned to the caller so that it has a reference to it.

; This concept of allowing the database manager to choose the group in which
; the item is allocated is termed "allocating an item ungrouped".

; This is somewhat of a misnomer, since the item has a group, and the
; application needs to specify the group when manipulating or accessing the
; item.

; The idea behind ungrouped items is that their group and item blocks are
; managed by the database manager in such a way that the group blocks are
; kept to a reasonable size.

; If an application has one type of data (say a simple rolodex database) but
; can have potentially thousands and thousands of records, it can use
; ungrouped allocation to force the database manager to do the bookkeeping
; regarding when to create a new group for records.
