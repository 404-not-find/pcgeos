;
; AppInstanceReference.  Holds enough info to be able to reload an instance
; of an application.  Stored in the application object itself, & copied
; into the field when the application is forcefully detached.
;
; DO NOT CHANGE THIS WITHOUT CHANGING "GENERIC.UIH"!!!

AppInstanceReference	struct
if DBCS_PCGEOS
	AIR_fileName	PathName
else
	AIR_fileName	char	PATH_BUFFER_SIZE dup (?)
endif
	; Application being launched.  Pathname is relative to application
	; directory (Which, of course, may be overriden with a direct path
	; to the app)

	AIR_stateFile	FileLongName
else
	AIR_stateFile	char	FILE_LONGNAME_BUFFER_SIZE dup (?)
endif
	; State filename.  File is assumed to be in standard directory for
	; PC/GEOS state files. If the first byte is "0", then there is no
	; state file for this application. This structure is copied into the
	; field as an aid in restarting applications, and if it comes across
	; one with this byte as 0, it will not restart it.

	AIR_diskHandle	word
	; Disk handle for app (passed in) IF 0, use System disk, if -1,
	; use AIR_diskName. In the field, if this is a placeholder structure,
	; this word is the handle of the application object we are waiting to
	; detach.

	AIR_savedDiskData  byte	0
	; Start of data stored by DiskSave when instance is saved to state.
	; Must be a single byte for compatibility with C definition...
	; 
AppInstanceReference	ends

;
; AppLaunchFlags.  Holds additional info governing how application should
; be run.
;
AppLaunchFlags	record
	ALF_SEND_LAUNCH_REQUEST_TO_UI_TO_HANDLE:1
	; If this bit is set, the application will not immediately
	; be launched, but instead the UI will be sent a method which
	; will cause it to do so.  Because of this, no error is returned.
	; (NOT passed to application itself, is only used by
	; UserLoadApplication)

	ALF_OPEN_IN_BACK:1
	; Set to open application behind other applications.
	; It will also ensure that if an application has multiple GenPrimaries,
	; (each with a different layer id), the GenPrimaries will be restored
	; in the correct order (one behind the other).
	; This flag is normally set when restoring from state.

	ALF_DESK_ACCESSORY:1
	; Set to open application as a "desk accessory", in a layer above
	; normal applications.

	ALF_DO_NOT_OPEN_ON_TOP:1
	; Set to prevent application from opening on top with the focus.

	ALF_OVERRIDE_MULTIPLE_INSTANCE:1
	; Set to prevent application, when running in a UILM_MULTIPLE_INSTANCE
	; field, from asking the user if s/he wishes to start another copy.
	; Used especially by the express menu...
	
        ALF_OPEN_FOR_IACP_ONLY:1
	; Used only for "MSG_GEN_PROCESS_OPEN_APPLICATION" mode connections.
        ; Set if app is being launched via IACPConnect for a specific task
	; only, & should close as an app once the task is complete, as
	; indicated by the IACP connection closing (unless there is some
	; other reason for the app to stay open, such as other app-mode
	; IACP connections, or a previous or subsequential opening of the app
	; for the user).  This bit should be clear whereever IACPConnect is
	; being used to open an app with the intention that the app is to
	; remain open after the IACP connection is closed.

	ALF_NO_ACTIVATION_DIALOG:1
	; Set to prevent the "Activating" dialog box from being displayed.

; Structure of block passed in MSG_META_ATTACH to any geode having a
; process marked as GA_APPLICATION:
;
AppLaunchBlock	struct

   ; PASSED STATE INFORMATION (preserved through state file)
   ;
	ALB_appRef	AppInstanceReference
	; Instance reference.  Contains full pathname to application, 
	; as referenced from app directory, plus the name of a state file.
	; Is enough info to launch application again, restored.
	; (State file need not be passed to GeodeLoad)
	;NOTE: THIS MUST BE THE FIRST FIELD IN THE STRUCTURE!

	ALB_appMode	word
	; Application attach mode method, currently, one of:
	;	  MSG_GEN_PROCESS_RESTORE_FROM_STATE
	;		State file MUST be passed, no data file should be
	;	  MSG_GEN_PROCESS_OPEN_APPLICATION
	;		State file normally should NOT be passed, although
	;		one could be to accomplish ui templates. A data
	;		file may be passed into the application as well
	;	  MSG_GEN_PROCESS_OPEN_ENGINE
	;		State file normally should NOT be passed.
	;		The data file on which the engine will operate
	;		MUST be passed.  If 0, the default data file should
	;		be used (Enforced by app, not GenProcessClass)

	ALB_launchFlags	AppLaunchFlags
	; Misc flags for clarifying desired type of launch for the application

   ; PASSED LAUNCH INFORMATION (NOT preserved through state file)
   ;
	ALB_diskHandle	word
	; Disk handle for data path.  (Set as app current path in
	; MSG_META_ATTACH for process)

	ALB_path	PathName
	; Data path for application to use as initial path.
	; (Usually dir of any data file passed)  (Set as app current path in
	; MSG_META_ATTACH for process)

	ALB_dataFile	FileLongName
	; Name of data file passed in to be opened (0 if none)
	; Pathname is relative to above path

	ALB_genParent	optr
	; Generic parent for new application (0 to put on default field)
	; (Should be passed null to MSG_GEN_FIELD_LAUNCH_APPLICATION)

	ALB_userLoadAckAD	ActionDescriptor
	; AD to activate when the application has been launched (used in 
	; conjunction with ALF_SEND_LAUNCH_REQUEST_TO_UI_TO_HANDLE)
	; (Set to 0 if you don't want to send anything)
	;
	; Passes:	cx - geode handle (if successful)
	;		dx - error (0 if no error)
	;		bp - ID passed in ALB_userLoadAckID

	ALB_userLoadAckID	word
	; ID sent out via ActionDescriptor
	;

	ALB_extraData	word
	; Extra data to be sent to process (possibly a handle to block 
	; containing arguments).
