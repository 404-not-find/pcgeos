DESCRIPTION:
	Assembly interface to the CXFer C library. The CXFer library is 
	used by the DummyXF Connect Transfer driver. The DummyXF driver 
	just calls this library to do the actuall file transfer work.

	This is a library written in C.  All paramaters will have
	to be pushed on the stack in order to be called.
