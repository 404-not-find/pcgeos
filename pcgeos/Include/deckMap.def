; Current revision of these definitions. This is the protocol number given
; to a card deck datafile that uses these structures. The protocol is checked
; by the Cards library before the deck is used.
;
; NOTE: The make used to parse this file and extract these constants to
; pass to glue.  But that was back in the Unix days, and we don't have
; such a smart shell in NT, so they're currently hard-coded in local.mk.
; Make sure if the protocol is changed here that it's changed there
; as well. -dhunter 2/11/2000

; Structure describing a particular supported device resolution.
; DRS_displayType is matched exactly against the DisplayType of the game's
; video driver.
DeckResStruct	struct
    DRS_displayType	DisplayType	; Resolution/color of expected display
    DRS_fontSize	word		; Suggested point size for things like
					;  score, winnings, etc.
    DRS_downSpreadX	word		; For face-down cards that spread
					;  horizontally, the amount of space
					;  to put between each.
    DRS_downSpreadY	word		; For face-down cards that spread
					;  vertically, the amount of space to
					;  put between each.
    DRS_upSpreadX	word		; For face-up cards that spread
					;  horizontally, the amount of space
					;  to put between each.
    DRS_upSpreadY	word		; For face-up cards that spread
					;  vertically, the amount of space to
					;  put between each.
    DRS_deckSpreadX	word		; For face-up cards that spread
					;  horizontally, the amount of space
					;  to put between each.
    DRS_deckSpreadY	word		; For face-up cards that spread
					;  vertically, the amount of space to
					;  put between each.
    DRS_mapBlock	word		; VM Block handle of map block
					;  containing DeckMapStruct for that
					;  resolution.
DeckResStruct	ends

; The structure at the start of the file's map block giving overall information
; about the deck.
DeckDirectoryStruct	struct
    DDS_arrayLength	word		; number of resolutions supported
    DDS_DRS		label	DeckResStruct	; array of resolution maps
DeckDirectoryStruct	ends


; Structure of a block that gives all necessary information about a chosen
; deck once the resolution has been decided on.
DeckMapStruct	struct
    DMS_cards		fptr	54 dup(?); VM block handle and offset for each
					 ;  card bitmap. Cards are ordered by
					 ;  suit (diamond, heart, club, spade)
					 ;  and by rank (ace through king, then
					 ;  ace then joker) within  the suit.

    DMS_frame		nptr.Region	; Region to draw to frame each card
    DMS_interior	nptr.Region	; Region inside the frame for clearing
					;  it out.
    DMS_winBack		fptr		; Card back to be used if the game is
					;  won, if appropriate
    DMS_numBacks	word		; Number of card backs in the deck.
    DMS_backs		label	fptr	; Array of VM far pointers to the
					;  different card backs.
