SetDef	__SOUNDEXLIB


;
;  The standard stream allocated by the SoundEx library to play a Song kept
;  in a GAF structure is:
;
SOUNDEX_SOUND_STREAM_SIZE	equ	SSS_MEDIUM	; 512 bytes


;
;  Getting/Setting the data in a GAF structure requires a lot of redundancy
;  of code (namely, locking and unlocking the various blocks).  Thus, to reduce
;  this, we create an entry routine that all the Get/Set routines for one
;  struture of the GAF call through.  This involves, of course, a jump table.
;  These are the types for that table.
;
;  Note that the order of these enums is _very_ important.  Before adding,
;  deleting, or changing this etype in _any_ way, be sure to veryify your
;  changes in soundexMemAccess.asm and soundexVMAccess.asm.
