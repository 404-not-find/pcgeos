DESCRIPTION:
	This contains definitions for routines to support UserTrace,
	a utility that draws complicated objects made out of horizontal
	and vertical lines, using up to 30 parameters, in a much tighter
	space than other methods.

;
; TRF_ROTATED -- Draws the object rotated 45 degrees to the right.  If your
; original data draws a vertical slider, setting this flag will draw a
; horizontal slider, drawing from right to left.
;
; TRF_SELECTED - Consulted when choosing line and area colors.  If this bit is
; set, areas are drawn in dark grey, left & top lines are drawn in black, etc.
; Can be set before calling VisTrace, or can be set in conjunction with
; TA_selFlags and the SET_SELECTED command.
;
; TRF_NEXT_SEL - Knows what the next selected state will be.  For instance,
; if up-arrow in scrollbar is currently being drawn, this bit tells whether
; the drag area is selected.  Used when drawing in JOINED_EDGE_COLOR type.
;

; This is required at the beginning of the structure passed in bp.
