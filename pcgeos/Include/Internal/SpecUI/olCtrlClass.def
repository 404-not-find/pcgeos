;	OLCtrlClass
;
OLCtrlClass	class VisCompClass
	uses	GenInteractionClass

;declared here and implemented in OLTriggerBar and OLMenuBar:

MSG_BAR_BUILD_INFO		message
; This is the continuation of the BUILD_INFO query, into the MenuBar or
; TriggerBar.

MSG_OL_CTRL_SET_VIS_PARENT	message
; Set the OLCI_visParent field for this object.
;	used by:
;		OLFieldAttachWorkOrAppMenu (if we set coorect hints on app
;				and work menus, could nuke this.)
;				Query would run again, and find primary
;				as parent to build on.
;		OpenWinCreateBarObject (same deal. Need hints to that
;				object is built upon primary)

MSG_QUERY_CENTER_BY_MONIKERS		message	VisSpecMessages
;
; Querys object to find out if their parent wants to center by monikers,
; and if it wants children to left justify the monikers in that case.  Only
; handled by OLCtrlClass at present.
;
; Pass:		nothing
; Return:	set carry if handled, with:
;			cl - OLCtrlOptFlags (relavent bits set)
;		monikers.
;

MSG_OL_GET_CHILDS_TREE_POS		message
;
;	Method implemented only at OLWin level.  A child object will send this
; message to its parent to find out if that parent is a non-menu window and
; if the child is the first child of the parent.  This information is used to
; artificially add some margins to the child that normally should be in the
; parent.  We can't put the margins in the parent because panes don't have
; those margins.  This probably doesn't make sense;  talk to Chris.
;
; 	Pass:	cx:dx -- handle of child
;	Return:	carry set if the child is in fact a child of a non-menu window.
;		(Non OLWin objects will not handle this method, leaving the
;		carry clear as well.)
;		cx -- FALSE if the child is not the first child.

MSG_VUP_GET_BUILD_FLAGS	message	VisSpecMessages
;
; Returns the OLBuildFlags for control group above us.
;
; Pass:		nothing
; Return:	CX	- OLCtrlBuildFlags (OLCI_buildFlags)
;		carry	- set to show query was responded to & CX is valid

MSG_VUP_GET_MORE_FLAGS	message	VisSpecMessages
;
; Returns the OLCtrlMoreFlags for control group above us, if there are any.
;
; Pass:		nothing
; Return:	CX	- OLCtrlMoreFlags (OLCI_moreFlags)
;		carry	- set to show query was responded to & CX is valid


MSG_GET_FIRST_MKR_POS	message	VisSpecMessages
;
; Returns moniker position of the control's first child. 
; 
; Pass:		nothing
; Return:	ax, cx -- moniker position of first child
;		carry set if method handled
;

MSG_SPEC_GET_TYPICAL_CHILD_EXTRA_SIZE	message
;
; Returns the typical size of a child.   Currently the default OLCtrl behavior
; is to return the extra insets of a button.   OLItemGroups return the extra
; insets of an item.
;
; Pass:		nothing
; Return:	al -- typical x inset
;		ah -- typical y inset
;		cx, dx, bp -- preserved
;

MSG_SPEC_CTRL_SET_MONIKER_OFFSET	message
;
; Sets moniker offsets that can be used by the OLCtrl, in case the usual
; messages (i.e. MSG_OL_GET_FIRST_MKR_POS to first child) don't work, like
; in the case of the view.
;
; Pass:		cx, dx -- moniker offsets to use, if applicable.
; Return:	nothing
;		ax, cx, dx, bp -- destroyed
;

MSG_SPEC_CTRL_SET_MORE_FLAGS		message	VisSpecMessages
;
; Sets OLCtrlMoreFlags.
;
; Pass:		cl -- OLCtrlMoreFlags to set
;		ch -- OLCtrlMoreFlags to clear
; Return:	nothing
;		ax, cx, dx, bp -- destroyed
;

MSG_SPEC_CTRL_UPDATE_CENTER_STUFF	message	VisSpecMessages
;
; Sent to an object with HINT_CENTER_ON_MONIKERS to reevaluate the largest
; moniker left-of-center.   This gets sent when the ctrl is invalid, when
; the children change their monikers or are set usable/not usable, etc.
; Actually, this will go to the top ctrl with this hint so that nested objects 
; with this hint are properly accounted for.
;
; Pass:		dl -- VisUpdateMode
; Return:	nothing
;		ax, cx, dx, bp -- destroyed
;

MSG_SPEC_CTRL_GET_LARGEST_CENTER	message VisSpecMessages
;
; Send to children of a HINT_CENTER_ON_MONIKERS ctrl to find the largest
; center (i.e. largest ctrl moniker) underneath us.
;
; Pass:		cx -- largest found so far
;		bp -- if any objects found so far with valid geometry
; Return:	cx -- updated as needed
;		bp -- updated as needed
;		ax, cx, dx, bp -- destroyed



if PARENT_CTRLS_INVERTED_ON_CHILD_FOCUS

MSG_SPEC_NOTIFY_CHILD_CHANGING_FOCUS		message VisSpecMessages
;
; When sent up from a child, and this is a center-on-monikers composite,
; allows the OLCtrl to do anything it has to do to redraw itself, in the
; wonderful Rudy UI.
;
; Pass:		cx -- MSG_META_GAINED/LOST_SYS_FOCUS_EXCL, as appropriate
;		dl -- top margin for inversion
;		dh -- bottom margin for inversion
; Return:	nothing
;		ax, cx, dx, bp -- destroyed
;

;top when a box is drawn around the OLCtrlClass object.  (Jedi)
;

;These flags are used during the Generic->Specific build sequence,
;and during SPEC_BUILD, when a GenTrigger or GenInteraction object
;sends a BUILD_INFO query up the generic tree to determine if the
;object should be visually placed beneath some other parent besides
;the generic parent. During the query, these flags are passed in bp.
;Before sending the query, bp is loaded with this record, with the
;flags set according to the hints set for the object. During the query,
;these flags are checked, and some are set.

OLBuildTargets		etype	byte
OLBT_NO_TARGET		enum	OLBuildTargets
	;NOT USED!!!

OLBT_SYS_MENU	enum	OLBuildTargets
	;Set for HINT_SYS_MENU. Indicates object is a system menu. Reserved
	;for Motif/CUA use only. Prevents BUILD_INFO query from occurring,
	;so menu button is first child in GenPrimary.

OLBT_REPLY_BAR	enum	OLBuildTargets
	;Set for HINT_MAKE_REPLY_BAR.  Used to create reply bar. tested
	;many times later on in OLCtrlClass to see if is reply bar or not.
	;Set for HINT_REPLY_BAR. GenInteraction or GenTrigger should go into
	;the reply bar if one exists

OLBT_FOR_REPLY_BAR	enum	OLBuildTargets
	;Set for HINT_SEEK_REPLY_BAR.  Put this object in
	;the interaction reply bar.

OLBT_IS_EXPRESS_MENU	enum	OLBuildTargets
	;Used internally.  This item is the express menu and should be made the
	;second child (in Motif), or the first child (in OpenLook).
	;IMPORTANT: this implies that OLBT_SYS_MENU is true, so it has the
	;same effects as HINT_SYS_MENU, plus some.

OLBT_IS_POPUP_LIST	enum	OLBuildTargets
	;Used internally, for building popup lists.  Causes the trigger to
	;be placed underneath its generic parent, rather than in a menu bar.

OLBT_FOR_TITLE_BAR_LEFT	enum	OLBuildTargets
	;Set for HINT_SEEK_TITLE_BAR_LEFT.  Put this object in the left part
	;of the window's title bar.
	;
	; This is not set in OLMapGroup like the other OLBT_TARGET types.
	; Instead this is set in OLCtrlInitialize, so it works for other
	; OLCtrl subclasses in addition to GenInteractions.

OLBT_FOR_TITLE_BAR_RIGHT	enum	OLBuildTargets
	;Set for HINT_SEEK_TITLE_BAR_RIGHT.  Put this object in the left part
	;of the window's title bar.
	;
	; This is not set in OLMapGroup like the other OLBT_TARGET types.
	; Instead this is set in OLCtrlInitialize, so it works for other
	; OLCtrl subclasses in addition to GenInteractions.

OLBuildReplies		etype byte
OLBR_NO_REPLY		enum OLBuildReplies			;NOT USED!
	;Returned when query was not answered.
OLBR_TOP_MENU		enum OLBuildReplies
	;Returned when object has been placed inside menu bar.
OLBR_SUB_MENU		enum OLBuildReplies
	;Returned when object has been placed inside a menu.
OLBR_REPLY_BAR		enum OLBuildReplies
	;Returned when object has been placed inside reply bar.

    OLBF_MENUABLE:1		;Set for GIV_POPUP GenInteractions. Indicates
				;this is a GenInteraction which contains items
				;that can be placed in a menu. If not set, is a
				;GenTrigger.
    OLBF_TRIGGER:1		;Set if is GenTrigger query
				;(only set in OLButtonGetVisParent --
				;	in copenButton.asm;
				; 	never tested)
    OLBF_SEEK_MENU_BAR:1	;Set for HINT_SEEK_MENU_BAR. Indicates this
				;GenTrigger should be forced into the menu
				;bar, even if that is stupid in this specific
				;UI.
    OLBF_AVOID_MENU_BAR:1	;Set for HINT_AVOID_MENU_BAR. Indicates this
				;GenTrigger should not be placed into the menu
				;bar, even if this specific UI generally does
				;that.

    OLBF_MENU_IN_DISPLAY:1	;Set for GIV_POPUP GenInteractions which
				;are inside a GenDisplay, as the Display sends
				;the query upwards to the DisplayControl.
				;The forces an OLCtrlClass object to be created
				;inside the GenPrimary's menu bar, so that
				;when this menu button appears and disappears,
				;the entire menu bar will not flash.
    OLBF_ALWAYS_ADOPT:1		;TRUE when is MENU_IN_DISPLAY and this
				;menu button is permanent - does not change
				;with TARGET exclusive.
    OLBF_TOOLBOX:1		;Set if HINT_TOOLBOX set for this object or the
				;object above it, says that this object and all 
    				;and all objects below it are part of a toolbox.
    OLBF_DELAYED_MODE:1		;Set in SPEC_BUILD based on the parent object's
				;   delayed mode flag.
    OLBF_TARGET OLBuildTargets:4
;Replies:
    OLBF_ABOVE_DISP_CTRL:1	;Returned when querying from inside a Display
				;window, and the object has been placed inside

	OLCOF_DISPLAY_MKR_ABOVE:1
; 			     Will display the moniker above the children.
	OLCOF_DISPLAY_BORDER:1
; 			     Will display a border around the composite, 
;			     centering the moniker (which should be above or
;			     below).
	OLCOF_IN_MENU:1
;			     Sitting in a menu if set.  Possibly redundant.
	OLCOF_CENTER_ON_MONIKER:1
;			     If set, object will calculate its center to be
;			     after its vis moniker.
	OLCOF_CUSTOM_SPACING:1
; 			     Set if programmer desires the objects to override
;			     the typical spacing in favor of some custom
;  			     spacing.
	OLCOF_IGNORE_DESIRED_SIZE_HINTS:1
;			     Set by the text object when it creates an OLCtrl
;			     to live in, so that we will ignore the desired
;			     size hints (the text object will take care of it)
;			     Also set by OLWin objects as an easy way to avoid
;			     being affected by HINT_FIXED_SIZE, etc.
	OLCOF_LEFT_JUSTIFY_MONIKERS:1
;			     Along with OLCOF_CENTER_ON_MONIKER, when set it
;			     forces moniker to be left justified, while still
;			     left-aligning the children.
