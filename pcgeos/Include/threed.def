;  The two flags that determine whether a points will be homogonized
; by ThreeDApplyMatrix.  This allows the ApplyMatrix routine to multiply
; 3D matrixes together while still being able to multiply a list of
; points.

;
;  The current 3D routines use a four coordinate three space representation.
; To all those 3D afficiandos this is called "homogenous" coordinates.
;
;  Like all things dealing with graphics, see Foley and VanDam.
;
Point3D		struct
	P_X	WWFixed		; X coordinate
	P_Y	WWFixed		; Y coordinate
	P_Z	WWFixed		; Z coordinate
	P_N	WWFixed		; Homogonize value (usually 1)

;
;  As points are homogonized, the transformation matrices are 4 by 4.
;
;  Notes:  The matrix 	[11 21 31 41]  is stored in col major order:
;			[12 22 32 42]
;			[13 23 33 43]
;			[14 24 34 44]
;
;	Stored as: 11,12,13,14,21,22,23,24,31,32,33,34,41,42,43,44
;
;   This should allow multiplication of point lists very quickly.
;   This is, obviously, assuming points will be stores as row-vectors.
