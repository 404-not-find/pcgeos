; The IDCF_TRIGGER feature provides a trigger that represents the current
; connection state of the PPP interface.  When online, simply clicking on
; it will start a disconnect.  When offline, the IDialup application is
; launched to allow the user to connect.  The trigger's moniker will be
; 'CONNECT' or 'DISCONNECT' in the CUI and simple icons depicting the
; connection in the AUI.  The trigger is designed for placement in a
; primary's title bar, so HINT_SEEK_TITLE_BAR_LEFT/RIGHT should be set for
; the controller object.
