; Pass:		nothing
; Returns:	ax -- left margin
;		bp -- top margin
;		cx -- right margin
;		dx -- bottom margin
;
	
MSG_VIS_COMP_GET_WRAP_COUNT		message
;	
; Called by the geometry manager if VCGA_WRAP_AFTER_CHILD_COUNT is set,
; to get the number of children to count before wrapping.
;
; Context:	Called by the destination when doing geometry calculations on
;		itself.
; Source:	No restrictions (usually same as destination)
; Destination:  A VisCompClass object.

;		of children.
;
; Pass:		nothing
; Returns:	cx -- child count
;		ax, dx, bp -- destroyed
;


; Arguments passed in bp to VisCompRecalcSize and VisCompPosition:

VisCompSpacingMarginsInfo record
	VCSMI_USE_THIS_INFO:1
	  ; VisCompCalcNewSize uses this info for the composite's spacing and 
	  ; margins.  If zero, will send MSG_VIS_COMP_GET_CHILD_SPACING and
	  ; MSG_VIS_COMP_GET_MARGINS to get the information it needs.

	VCSMI_LEFT_MARGIN:3
	VCSMI_TOP_MARGIN:3
	VCSMI_RIGHT_MARGIN:3
	VCSMI_BOTTOM_MARGIN:3
	  ; Margins to use when doing geometry, rather than sending a MSG_VIS_-
	  ; COMP_GET_MARGINS.

	VCSMI_CHILD_SPACING:3
	  ; Spacing (both between children and between wrapped lines) to use
	  ; in lieu of MSG_VIS_COMP_GET_CHILD_SPACING.

VisCompGeoAttrs	record
	VCGA_ORIENT_CHILDREN_VERTICALLY:1
		;Place the composite's children vertically, rather than 
		;horizontally.
		
	VCGA_INCLUDE_ENDS_IN_CHILD_SPACING:1
		;When used with full justification, divides the spacing up
		;so that there is as much space allocated before the first
		;child and after the last child as there are between the
		;children.  An example of this is a motif reply bar.  When
		;this is clear, there is no space allocated at the ends of the
		;composite.
		
	VCGA_ALLOW_CHILDREN_TO_WRAP:1
		;Allows children to wrap if their combined lengths will not
		;allow them to fit inside the bounds of this object's parent.
		;The composite will keep within the bounds of its parent and 
		;wrap the children as necessary.  When this is clear, the
		;children will force the composite to be as big as needed
		;to fit the children on one line (unless, of course, the 
		;CAN_TRUNCATE_WIDTH_TO_FIT_PARENT flags are set.)
		
	VCGA_ONE_PASS_OPTIMIZATION:1			
		;This is an optimization which speeds up the geometry manager,
		;only making one pass of sizing the children and using the
		;sum of the sizes as the size of the composite.  In order
		;to use this flag, you must be sure that the children don't
		;want to wrap, and are always one size, regardless of the
		;size of the parent, such as buttons in a horizontal composite.
		
	VCGA_CUSTOM_MANAGE_CHILDREN:1
		;Don't use the geometry manager to manage the children.  
		;This allows you to set up the sizes and positions of the
		;children without the need of the geometry manager.  If this
		;is flag is set, the composite will be default return its
		;current size when asked to calculate its size, like a simple
		;non-composite object.
		
	VCGA_HAS_MINIMUM_SIZE:1
		;Geometry manager will send a MSG_VIS_COMP_GET_MIN_SIZE
		;to this object if this flag is set, and always make the 
		;composite at least as big as that.
		
	VCGA_WRAP_AFTER_CHILD_COUNT:1
		;Used in conjunction with VCGA_ALLOW_CHILDREN_TO_WRAP.
		;If set, composite will wrap after a certain number of 
		;children, the number being obtained from a MSG_VIS_COMP_
		;GET_CHILD_WRAP_COUNT.
		
	VCGA_ONLY_DRAWS_IN_MARGINS:1
		;This flag can be set by a composite to optimize invalidation.
		;If set, a composite whose image is invalid will only have its
		;margins invalidated.  Any visual child below it will have to
		;have its image invalid in order to get invalidated.  To get
		;proper invalidations, the composite cannot draw anything inside
		;its margins (that isn't the color of the background).
