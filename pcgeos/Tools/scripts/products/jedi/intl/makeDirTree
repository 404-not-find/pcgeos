# This script is to copy the directory tree structure from the input directory.
#
# Syntax:
#	makeDirTree <input dir>
#
# Example:
#	cd /staff/pcgeos/JediGerman/Installed
#	makeDirTree /staff/pcgeos/Release20X/Installed
#
# This command will create the same dir tree structure under the current
# directory as the one under the input directory.
# NOTE: a file called $USER.$$ is created. That file contains the name of 
#       symbolic link files under the input tree structure. That reason
#       why we want that file is because some symbolic links may be dirs.
#       So you may need to create that directory by hand.
