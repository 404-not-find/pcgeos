The Socket library supports the notion of urgent data. This allows a short packet of data to cut in front of other packets. To send a packet marked urgent, pass the SSF_URGENT flag to <CODE>
SocketSend()</CODE>
.</P>
<P>
In some domains, only one byte of data in a packet can be marked urgent. In such a domain, passing SSF_URGENT with a 32-byte packet to <CODE>
SocketSend()</CODE>
 results in two packets being sent: a 1-byte urgent packet and a 31-byte non-urgent packet. The data of the 1-byte urgent packet is the last byte of the original 32-byte packet. Check your domain documentation for size limits on urgent packets.</P>
<P>
Urgent data may be delivered out of order. It may arrive out of sync with non-urgent packets; it may arrive out of order with other urgent packets. There is no queue for urgent data. Each urgent data packet received causes the previous urgent data to be discarded.</P>
<P>
The <CODE>
SocketRecv()</CODE>
 routine, in charge of receiving incoming packets, may be instructed to receive only urgent data or only non-urgent data. If there is pending urgent data and <CODE>
SocketRecv()</CODE>
 is told to poll for normal data, it will return an error value, SE_URGENT, signalling that the program should call <CODE>
SocketRecv()</CODE>
 again, this time to receive urgent data. (If, instead, you call <CODE>
SocketRecv()</CODE>
 telling it to receive normal data again, it will return any pending normal data; it will not generate the SE_URGENT exception for the pending piece of urgent data -- unless <EM>
another</EM>
 piece of urgent data has arrived in the meantime.)</P>
<P>
Datagram connections do not support urgent data; <CODE>
SocketRecv()</CODE>
 generates an SE_URGENT error on a datagram connection, it's really generating a SE_EXCEPTION value. If you receive such an error, it is a sign that the network is having troubles and packets <EM>
may</EM>
 not be getting through.</P>
<P>
You may force incoming urgent data to be treated in the same manner as normal data by setting the socket's &quot;in-line&quot; option. See <A HREF="Socket_d.htm#41687"> SO_INLINE: In-line urgent data To force urgent data to be treated the same as normal data. This allows you to poll for both urgent and normal data with a single SocketRecv() command. Of course, setting this option means that you will not receive</A>
 for information about socket options.</P>
