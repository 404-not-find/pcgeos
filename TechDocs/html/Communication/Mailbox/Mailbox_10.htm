<P>
The application is insulated from most of the mundane responsibilities of transmitting and receiving data. Its behavior is event-driven. It has to know how to respond to a variety of requests from the Mailbox library; however, it generally does not have to initiate action on its own.</P>
<P>
There are a number of specific tasks an application must perform:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
It must provide the right UI (usually in the form of controllers) for using the Inbox/Outbox functionality. It can do this by including the appropriate controllers.</LI>
<LI>
It must package data into an acceptable format. When the user selects data to transmit (which could be a small message or an entire document), it must format the data appropriately.</LI>
<LI>
It must be able to handle incoming messages. This consists of notifying the user that new data has been received, incorporating the data into the document (or adding a new document containing the data), delete the message it's been sent, and notify the Mailbox library that it has received the data.</LI>
</UL>
