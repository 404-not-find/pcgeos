<P>
The transport driver handles actually sending a message of the device. It interacts with the actual hardware used for sending the message. This document does not attempt to discuss creating transport drivers in detail.</P>
<P>
Messages are received much the way they are delivered. The transport driver receives a message, registers it with the Mailbox library, and passes its data, block by block, to the appropriate data driver. The data driver translates this message into its own data format. The Mailbox library stores the message in its <EM>
inbox</EM>
 until it can deliver the message. When the appropriate time for delivery is reached, the Mailbox library starts up an appropriate application (if it is not already running) and passes the message to the application. The application must notify the Mailbox library when it has finished with the message.</P>
<P>
A user or application can address a message to the local machine. In this case, the message will not be sent to the transport driver; the Mailbox library will deliver the message simply by moving it from the machine's outbox to its inbox.</P>
