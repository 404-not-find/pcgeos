<P>
Your localization workload will vary depending on whether you plan to release your software in other countries. If you don't plan on exporting your software, your only contact with localization will come when you use the common functions that are localized. If you plan on international distribution, you'll be using localization both when writing your geodes and later on, during the translation process, in the following steps:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Use provided routines.<BR>
Several GEOS functions have been localized to handle foreign variations, and you should use these whether you plan international release or not. Most of these functions are concerned with &quot;International formats&quot; and character sets.</LI>
<LI>
Plan ahead for <CODE>
ResEdit</CODE>
.<BR>
You'll probably use the <CODE>
ResEdit</CODE>
 tool if you translate your software into other languages. You'll have to be careful about how you write your programs if <CODE>
ResEdit</CODE>
 is to work with them properly. Any text in your geode that the user may see will have to be translated. <CODE>
ResEdit</CODE>
 looks only at chunk is in localizable resources. You should also be prepared for the translations of any string to be longer than the original. You may want to provide instructions for translators. You may include these instructions within the body of your source code, close to the strings that will be translated.</LI>
<LI>
Use <CODE>
ResEdit</CODE>
.<BR>
The <CODE>
ResEdit</CODE>
 tool makes translation easy. It goes through an application's resources and checks all objects for strings and bitmaps, asking the translator to make any fitting changes. The translator never needs to see the source code and doesn't have to know how to program.</LI>
