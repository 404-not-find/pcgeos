<P>
Writing routines for a library is very much like writing them for an application. Simply export the routine in the <STRONG CLASS="fileName">
.gp</STRONG>
 file and any geode which uses the library will be able to call the routine.</P>
<P>
It is important when writing routines for export to document the routines exhaustively. Remember that the library will probably be used by other programmers; they will rely on the routines to behave exactly as specified. Exported routines should also minimize side effects; for example, it is a bad idea for a library routine to change the working directory without changing it back, unless that is the routine's main purpose.</P>
<P>
Most libraries will have a number of routines which are not for export, but are used by routines that are exported. These are simply written normally, and are not exported in the <CODE>
.gp</CODE>
 or declared in the header file. Remember that programmers will not see these routines; their side effects should thus be fully documented with the exported routines which call them.</P>
<P>
Some libraries will declare classes of objects. In this case, the library should specify in the <STRONG CLASS="fileName">
.gp</STRONG>
 file that it uses whichever library defines the superclass of the object. For example, if a library defines a subclass of <CODE>
GenClass</CODE>
, it should specify that it uses the <STRONG CLASS="fileName">
UI</STRONG>
 library. It should then export the new class.</P>
<P>
Some libraries will declare classes that are not intended to be used by clients. For example, the Impex library declares <CODE>
ImportExportClass</CODE>
. This class is never instantiated; it contains code and instance data that are used by its subclasses (<CODE>
ImportControlClass</CODE>
 and <CODE>
ExportControlClass</CODE>
). Such &quot;hidden&quot; classes need not be exported. However, the classes must be fully declared in the header files so the subclasses can be defined accurately and consistently.</P>
