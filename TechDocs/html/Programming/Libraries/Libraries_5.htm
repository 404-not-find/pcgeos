<P>
Every library should have at least one header file. This file contains declarations and definitions which are needed by each of the geodes which uses the library.</P>
<P>
If a library exports routines but does not export object classes, its header will be a standard C header file. This file should contain declarations of every exported routine. It should also contain the definitions of any macros, constants, structures, etc., which clients might use. </P>
<P>
If a library exports object classes, its header will be a Goc header with the suffix <STRONG CLASS="fileName">
.goh</STRONG>
. In addition to routine declarations, it must contain the complete declarations of each of the exported object classes, including all the message declarations. A <STRONG CLASS="fileName">
.goh</STRONG>
 file should begin with the Goc directive &quot;<CODE>
@deflib &lt;</CODE>
libname&gt;&quot;, and end with the directive &quot;<CODE>
@endlib</CODE>
&quot;. This ensures that the header will only be included once, even if the code tries to include it several times.</P>
<P>
Large libraries may have several header files. For example, a library might declare several similar object classes. It is usually simpler to write a separate header for each class; a client can then include only the headers for classes which it will use. Note that the header for a class should use a Goc <CODE>
@include</CODE>
 directive to include the header for that class's superclass.</P>
<P>
It is of the utmost importance that the headers be kept in synchronization with the libraries they describe. As a rule, a library will include each one of those headers; that helps to keep all the files compatible. Nevertheless, you must be careful whenever changing a library.</P>
