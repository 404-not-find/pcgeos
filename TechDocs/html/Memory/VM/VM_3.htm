<P>
The VM manager can be thought of as a memory manager for a disk-based heap, providing all the services a memory manager would and more. The VM manager provides for allocation, use, and deallocation of virtual memory blocks. It manages the Block Table, enlarging it as necessary when more VM block handles are needed. It keeps track of which VM blocks have been loaded into memory, which are currently in use, and which have been &quot;dirtied&quot; (modified) since they were read from the disk; it also keeps track of how many threads are accessing a given VM file at any time. The VM manager also accomplishes all swapping and read/write operations involving VM files. </P>
