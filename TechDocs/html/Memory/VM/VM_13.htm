<A NAME="IX_VMCopyVMBlock()">
 </A>
If you would like to duplicate a VM block, or copy it to another file, call <CODE>
VMCopyVMBlock()</CODE>
. This routine is passed three arguments:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
The <CODE>
VMFileHandle</CODE>
 of the file containing the source block.</LI>
<LI>
The <CODE>
VMBlockHandle</CODE>
 of the source block.</LI>
<LI>
The <CODE>
VMFileHandle</CODE>
 of the destination file (which may be the same as the source file).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The routine makes a complete duplicate of the source block, copying it to the destination file. It returns the <CODE>
VMBlockHandle</CODE>
 of the duplicate block. Note that the duplicate block will almost certainly have a different block handle than the source block. If the block contains a copy of its own handle, you should update it accordingly.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IX_Relocatable data:VM operations">
 </A>
Sometimes you will need to perform special actions whenever loading a block into memory or writing it to the disk. For example, you may store data in a compressed format on the disk, and need to expand it when it's loaded into memory. For this reason, you can set a <EM>
relocation</EM>
 routine. This routine will be called whenever the following situations occur:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
A VM block has just been copied from the disk into memory (routine will be passed the flag VMRT_RELOCATE_AFTER_READ).</LI>
<LI>
A block is about to be written from memory to the disk (routine is passed VMRT_UNRELOCATE_BEFORE_WRITE).</LI>
<LI>
A block in memory has just been written to the disk, but is not being discarded (routine is passed VMRT_RELOCATE_AFTER_WRITE).</LI>
<LI>
A VM block has just been loaded from a resource (routine is passed VMRT_RELOCATE_FROM_RESOURCE). This is called by the relocating object, not by the VM manager.</LI>
<LI>
A VM block is about to be written to a resource (routine is passed VMRT_UNRELOCATE_FROM_RESOURCE). This is called by the unrelocating object, not by the VM manager.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="IX_VMSetReloc()">
 </A>
Using the routine <CODE>
VMSetReloc()</CODE>
, you can instruct the VM manager to call your relocation routine whenever appropriate.</P>
