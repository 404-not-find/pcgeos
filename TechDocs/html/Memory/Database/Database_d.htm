<PRE>DBReAlloc(), DBInsertAt(), DBDeleteAt()</PRE>
<P>
Database items may be resized after allocation. They may be expanded either by having bytes added to the end or by having bytes inserted at a specified offset within the item. Similarly, items may be contracted by having bytes truncated or by having bytes deleted from the middle of the item. When an item is resized, the DB manager automatically dirties the item block (or blocks) affected.</P>
<P>
As noted above, when an item is expanded, its item block can be compacted or moved on the item heap (even if the item is locked). Thus, pointers to all items in that item block may be invalidated, even if they are locked. For that reason, you should unlock all items in the group before expanding any of them. If you must leave an item locked, be sure to get its new address with <CODE>
DBDeref()</CODE>
. If you <EM>
decrease</EM>
 an item's size, the item-block is guaranteed not to move or be compacted. Thus, you can safely contract locked items (or items in the same block as locked items).</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IX_DBReAlloc()">
 </A>
To set a new size for an item, call <CODE>
DBReAlloc()</CODE>
. This routine takes four arguments: the file handle, the group-handle, the item-handle, and the new size (in bytes). If the new size is smaller than the old, bytes will be truncated from the end of the item. If the new size is larger than the old, bytes will be added to the end of the item; these bytes will not be zero-initialized.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IX_DBInsertAt()">
 </A>
To insert bytes in the middle of an item, call the routine <CODE>
DBInsertAt()</CODE>
. This routine takes five arguments: the file handle, the group-handle, the item-handle, the offset (within the item) at which to insert the bytes, and the number of bytes to insert. The new bytes will be inserted beginning at that offset; they will be zero-initialized. Thus, if you insert ten bytes beginning at offset 35, the new bytes will be at offsets 35-44; the byte which had been at offset 35 will be moved to offset 45. To insert bytes at the beginning of an item, pass an offset of zero.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IX_DBDeleteAt()">
 </A>
To delete bytes from the middle of an item, call <CODE>
DBDeleteAt()</CODE>
. This routine takes five arguments: the file handle, the group-handle, the item-handle, the offset (within the item) of the first byte to delete, and the number of bytes to delete. The routine does not return anything.</P>
