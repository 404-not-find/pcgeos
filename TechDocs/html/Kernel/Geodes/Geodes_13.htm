If your geode needs an action to happen on a timed basis, you will want to use a timer. GEOS lets you set up timers that will call a routine or send a message after a given interval has passed. GEOS offers four types of timers:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
One-shot<BR>
A one-shot timer counts a certain number of &quot;ticks.&quot; (There are 60 ticks in a second.) It will call a routine or send a message after the specified number of ticks have been counted.</LI>
<LI>
Continual<BR>
A continual timer counts a certain number of ticks and then resets and counts again. Each time it reaches the specified number of ticks, it calls a routine or sends a message.</LI>
<LI>
Millisecond<BR>
A millisecond timer is a one-shot timer that counts in milliseconds rather than ticks and calls a routine when time is up (it does not send a message).</LI>
<LI>
Sleep<BR>
A sleep timer causes the thread that creates it to sleep for a certain number of ticks. The sleep timer is unlike the others in that it does not send a message or call a routine when time is up; it only awakens the sleeping thread.</LI>
<LI>
Real-time<BR>
A real-time timer is passed the number of days since 1980, the hour, and the minute of the event. On hardware platforms that support such a thing, GEOS will wake up when the real-time timer goes off. (All other timers are ignored under these conditions.)</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="IX_TimerStart()">
 </A>
All timers except sleep timers are created and started with the routine <CODE>
TimerStart()</CODE>
, and continual timers can be destroyed with<A NAME="IX_TimerStop()">
 </A>
 <CODE>
TimerStop()</CODE>
. <CODE>
TimerStop()</CODE>
 may also be used to prematurely stop a one-shot timer, though if the one-shot sent a message, the message could be in the recipient's queue even after <CODE>
TimerStop()</CODE>
 was called. <A NAME="IX_TimerSleep()">
 </A>
Sleep timers are created and started with <CODE>
TimerSleep()</CODE>
, and they do not need to be stopped.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IX_TimerGetCount()">
 </A>
An additional routine, <CODE>
TimerGetCount()</CODE>
, returns the current system counter. The system counter contains the number of ticks counted since GEOS was started.</P>
