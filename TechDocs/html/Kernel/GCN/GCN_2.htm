<P>
The basic GCN functionality manages lists of objects that are interested in specific changes. For each particular change that needs to be monitored, a separate list is needed. A completely separate &quot;list of lists&quot; containing an inventory of all GCN lists is also created. This will serve as the &quot;search&quot; table, while the particular GCN list will serve as the &quot;messaging&quot; list. When an event is detected, the GCN mechanism will search through the list of lists, seeing if a notification list is interested in a particular change, and send the appropriate messages if the objects do indeed wish notification of the event.

There are several reasons why you would want to use GCN:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Ease of use<BR>
The GCN mechanism eliminates the need to monitor and dispatch messages relating to system changes.</LI>
<LI>
Commonality<BR>
The GCN mechanism provides a common platform for communication between applications in certain cases.</LI>
<LI>
The system expects you to<BR>
Many messages sent by the system expect a GCN mechanism to intercept them. Although you can intercept these messages manually, it is easier to take advantage of GCN's built-in functions.</LI>
