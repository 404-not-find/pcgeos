<P>
The Nokia 9000i Communicator comes with a disk containing the software by which a PC may be made to act as a server machine for the <STRONG CLASS="fileName">
Install/Remove software</STRONG>
 application. The phone can make either a serial or IR connection with the PC. (For an IR connection, the PC must be running MS Windows 95 and the IR monitoring software which comes with it.)</P>
<OL>
<LI>
From MS Windows 3.1 or Windows 95, run the program called <CODE>
server</CODE>
 on the floppy disk to install a program called <CODE>
NServer</CODE>
 onto the PC. </LI>
<LI>
Run <CODE>
NServer</CODE>
 to turn your PC into a server for the Nokia 9000i Communicator. This program monitors one of the PC's COM ports.</LI>
<LI>
Make sure that the <CODE>
NServer</CODE>
 program is monitoring the right COM port--check its Settings.</LI>
</OL>
<P>
If the user makes a serial or IR connection between a Nokia 9000i Communicator and a PC running the NServer, then runs the <STRONG CLASS="fileName">
Install/Remove software</STRONG>
 application on the phone, they can install packages from the PC to their phone.</P>
<P>
The <STRONG CLASS="fileName">
Install/Remove software</STRONG>
 application needs to know which directory to scan for Package Definition files. By default, the Install/Remove software application will look in the PC's A:\NSERVER directory--allowing for easy installation directly from floppy. If the files reside on the PC's hard drive, they should probably reside in C:\NSERVER; if they don't, make sure that the user knows where to look for them. To avoid clutter, you might want to put each &quot;package&quot; of files into its own directory under the directory containing the package description files.</P>
