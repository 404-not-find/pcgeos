The Short Message Service (SMS) is a protocol designed to transmit short alpha-numeric messages via a dedicated cellular provider's &quot;service center.&quot; SMS is built into the GSM (Global System for Mobile communications) standard that has gained general acceptance within Europe; SMS will also most likely be integrated into whatever digital cellular network becomes the de-facto standard within the United States.</P>
<P>
The Nokia 9000i Communicator is compliant with the transmission and 
reception of SMS protocol messages according to the GSM standard. With 
SMS, it is possible to create applications and services that request 
and retrieve short text messages (up to 160 characters) to any server 
or user on the GSM network. The ability to send and receive short 
messages can enable a wide variety of services. For example, short 
messages can be used to retrieve stock quotes, place horse-racing bets 
at a paramutual facility, or play chess with another member of the GSM 
network. The possible uses for the SMS protocol are almost limitless. 
A service need only be connected to the GSM network.</P>
<P>
Geoworks' Mailbox library includes built-in transmission and receipt of SMS messages. The elements of the Mailbox library that are of concern to SMS application developers have been excerpted and included in this chapter.You will not need to understand the inner workings of the Mailbox library to write an SMS application or service.</P>
<P>
Before reading this chapter, you should be familiar with cellular technologies, the SMS standard and elementary GEOS programming--in particular, the use of GEOS Virtual Memory (VM) files.</P>
