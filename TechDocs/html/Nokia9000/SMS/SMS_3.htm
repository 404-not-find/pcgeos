<P>
The purpose of the Mailbox library is to let applications send and receive information to and from other computers, through a variety of communications media. The mailbox insulates the application as much as possible from the mechanics of transmitting and receiving the information.</P>
<P>
In order to use the Mailbox library, an application must package information in a format acceptable to both a data driver (which stores the message) and a transport driver (which sends the message) -- in this case the SMS transport driver. The application then <EM>
registers</EM>
 this message with the Mailbox library. During the registration process, you specify in which data format the message is stored.</P>
<P>
The Mailbox library stores messages that have not yet been transmitted in its <EM>
outbox</EM>
. Messages are held in the outbox until the hardware connection necessary for transmission is available. An application can also specify that a message not be delivered until a specific time. In this case, the message will automatically remain in the outbox until that time. While a message is in the outbox, the device's user can examine information about the message and delay or even cancel its delivery.</P>
<P>
When the time comes to send the message, the Mailbox library activates the appropriate transport driver. This activation is transparent to an application developer.</P>
