<P>
The Short Message Service protocol handles a &quot;short message&quot; of up to 160 characters. The SMS standard of 160 characters allows you to send a text message to any single node (address) on the GSM network by way of a dedicated cellular service provider. </P>
<P>
The cellular service provider is responsible for managing incoming SMS messages and holding them until the recipient's phone becomes active. The length of time that an SMS message should be held can be specified by the sending party. This is known as a<EM>
 validity period</EM>
.</P>
<P>
The cellular provider may also elect to deliver the message in a format other than SMS. This is done at the server through a <EM>
message</EM>
 <EM>
conversion</EM>
 into the alternative format (e.g., as a fax message, as an email, as a page, etc.) This alternative method of delivery may also be specified by the sending party (though, of course, the recipient must have the means to handle such a format).</P>
<P>
Because the SMS message is so short, it is guaranteed to be delivered as a single packet of information.</P>
