<P>
Any SMS message that is sent out to the cellular provider is routed through the mailbox's <EM>
outbox</EM>
. There are three basic paradigms involved in packaging up information for use by the outbox. Although knowledge of how they work is not essential to sending an SMS message, it may be important when troubleshooting problems.</P>
<P>
Apart from any parameters sent to the mailbox, the three basic pieces of information the outbox needs to know in order to send a message are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
In what data format the message is &quot;wrapped.&quot; The mailbox can handle any data format as long as it is wrapped (contained) in a format it can understand. The mailbox calls an appropriate &quot;data driver&quot; when storing the message before it is sent.</LI>
<LI>
The type of data being sent. (The mailbox, itself, does not need to know the actual data; it only needs to know how the data is wrapped.) Telling the mailbox what the data is provides a black box abstraction.</LI>
<LI>
The transport driver to use when sending the message.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
When a message is placed in the outbox, the mailbox calls the appropriate data driver to store the data. When a connection is made, the mailbox calls the appropriate transport driver and sends the message. Note that the mailbox itself does not need to know the message's contents, or even its format.</P>
