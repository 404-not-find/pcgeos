<P>
For a typical configuration, you will have to set up a GenInteraction as a dialog box. (For information dialog boxes, see <A HREF="../../UI/GenInteraction/index.htm">the Menus and Dialog Boxes chapter</A>.) The File Selector and other elements of the dialog should be placed as children of the Interaction.</P><P>
<A HREF="FileSelectors_3.htm#24357"> A Basic File Selector</A>
 shows the Goc code required to display and use a File Selector in this basic form. You can use this code to create a similar dialog box with the proper elements or modify it to gain the functionality you want. Specific permutations of this configuration will be described in <A HREF="FileSelectors_6.htm#16485"> Some Common Customizations</A>
; however, the remainder of this section describes the basics of the File Selector.</P>
