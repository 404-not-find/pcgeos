<P>
Although the basics are all covered under the previous sections and you need nothing more to add a File Selector to your application, you will probably want to customize it somewhat. Typical simple customizations include limiting the types of files displayed, restricting the search to a single directory or volume, limiting the display to directories only (no files), and limiting the search to only those files with a given filename extension.</P>
<P>
Each of these is shown in the displays following this section. Notice that the only changes you need to make to implement any of these customizations is to the File Selector's Goc code. You will not need to handle any other messages or add other code to your application. These customizations are shown in <A HREF="FileSelectors_6.htm#16786"> Display Only Directories</A>
 through <A HREF="FileSelectors_6.htm#68431"> Show Only Files with a Given Filename Extension</A>
 and show how to do the following (you may apply any combination):</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Show directories only.<BR>
The File Selector will display no files, only directories.</LI>
<LI>
Show all files in a single directory.<BR>
The File Selector will show all files but will restrict directory navigation; the user can only select files in the current directory.</LI>
<LI>
Show hidden files as well as normal files.</LI>
<LI>
Show all files created by a given geode.<BR>
The File Selector will restrict displayed files to only those that were created by the geode with the given <CODE>
tokenChars</CODE>
 and <CODE>
tokenID</CODE>
.</LI>
<LI>
Show all files with a given filename extension.<BR>
The File Selector will restrict the files displayed to only those with the given filename extension.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
These are not the only customizations you can make. Although they will satisfy the needs of the large majority of applications, you can change the File Selector's searches any way you want (you can even set up a callback routine to filter every single file or directory). The remainder of this chapter explains in detail the different things you can do to the File Selector.</P>
