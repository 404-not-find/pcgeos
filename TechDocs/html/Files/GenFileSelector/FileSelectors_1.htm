<P>
When you are not using the Document Control objects but need to allow the user to traverse directories and disks in order to locate a given file, you should use a GenFileSelector. The File Selector is designed to give tremendous flexibility for many different types of file searches, providing both directory scanning and user interface. An OSF/Motif File Selector is shown below.</P>
<P>
The File Selector allows users to browse all the directories and disks readable by DOS, including readable network drives. This browsing is completely internal to the File Selector; until the user selects a file from the list, your application does not need to know what the File Selector is doing.</P>
<P>
You can customize the searches the File Selector makes in several different ways:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Setting paths, volumes, and selections<BR>
You may direct the File Selector to show any given directory on any given volume, and you may also set the selected file displayed. Additionally, you can navigate directories with messages sent to the File Selector. See <A HREF="FileSelectors_13.htm#20958"> The Current Selection</A>
.</LI>
<LI>
Limiting a directory scan to certain files<BR>
The File Selector can limit its directory scans to show only the files you request. You may limit the scan based on file types, file attributes, or filename extensions. See <A HREF="FileSelectors_7.htm#50084"> File Selector Instance Data</A>
.</LI>
<LI>
Searching for associated files<BR>
You can limit the File Selector's searches to only those files that match a given creator or token. That is, the File Selector will display only files created by a particular geode. See <A HREF="FileSelectors_a.htm#53091"> Matching a File's Token</A>
.</LI>
<LI>
Customizing the searches<BR>
If the available search options don't fit your needs, you can create a customized search. If this type of search is employed, the File Selector will send a special message to itself--to take advantage of this, you can easily subclass the GenFileSelector and write a custom handler for this special message. See <A HREF="FileSelectors_f.htm#27532"> Searching Via Callback Routine</A>
.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
All of the directory scanning and path navigation is internal to the GenFileSelector. When a selection is made (a user single- or double-clicks on an entry, for example), the File Selector will send out a message indicating the selection. You can, however, force the File Selector to change to any directory or search criteria at any time.
