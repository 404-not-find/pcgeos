<P>
To use the File Selector as shown in <A HREF="FileSelectors_3.htm#24357"> A Basic File Selector</A>
, your application must have some object (which may be the Process object) that can handle all the cases that may arise from a user's interaction with the dialog box. All of these cases are listed below:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
The user clicks once on an entry in the File Selector's list.<BR>
When this happens, the File Selector highlights the selected entry and sends its notification message to its destination object. With the message will come a record of flags indicating the action was a single click.</LI>
<LI>
The user double-clicks on an entry in the File Selector's list.<BR>
This action causes the File Selector to send its notification message to its destination object. The default action for the dialog box containing the File Selector will also occur (e.g. the default action is what happens when the &quot;Insert&quot; trigger is pressed). If the current selection is a directory, the application does not need to do anything; the File Selector will open the directory automatically. If the current selection is a file, the application must deal with the file properly and then close the dialog box containing the File Selector.</LI>
<LI>
The user clicks on the &quot;Insert&quot; trigger.<BR>
This action causes the trigger to send its notification message to its destination object. In most cases, the trigger with be an IC_OK trigger that will cause the File Selector to act as if a double-click had occurred. If the current selected entry in the list is a directory, the application should instruct the File Selector to open the directory and display its file list. If the current selection is a file, the application is responsible for dealing properly with the file; additionally, the application should then close the dialog box containing the File Selector.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The above list describes the basics of File Selector support. Different File Selectors (such as SaveAs dialogs that allow the user to type in a file name) can easily be defined by adding other gadgetry to the controller. All other actions possible are internal to the file selector (e.g. the &quot;Go To Document&quot; button is a feature of the File Selector which is invisible to the application).</P>
