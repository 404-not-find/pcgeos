<P>
The list objects provide a highly flexible way to display and manage user-selectable options. Depending on the Specific UI and the type of list, these objects may be built out in a variety of fashions. In some UIs, BooleanGroups may appear as checkboxes, GenItemGroups may appear as radio buttons, etc. </P>
<P>
You may manipulate the grouping objects in much the same way as a GIV_SUB_GROUP GenInteraction. For example, hints may alter the placement and dimensions of the grouping object's children or the list may appear with special dimensions. The items themselves are simple generic objects that can be easily added to your grouping object. The grouping object will manage the geometry and selection state of these children; it will also perform any required actions based on the state of these children.

<P>
There are three list management objects. </P>
<UL>
<LI>
<CODE>
GenItemGroup<BR>
</CODE>
An all-purpose grouping object, this list may be exclusive (only one item may be selected at a time) or non-exclusive and may also have scroll bars. A GenItemGroup may only contain <CODE>
GenItemClass</CODE>
 objects as its children.</LI>
<LI>
<CODE>
GenBooleanGroup<BR>
</CODE>
This list is designed for entries that are either true of false (&quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot;) independent of other entries. The BooleanGroup keeps track of its selections with a bitfield representing the boolean state of each of its children. A GenBooleanGroup object may only contain <CODE>
GenBooleanClass</CODE>
 objects.</LI>
<LI>
<CODE>
GenDynamicList<BR>
</CODE>
This list is designed for very long or changing length lists. In many respects it is similar to a GenItemGroup but also allows efficient dynamic lists. A GenDynamicList does not specify any explicit &quot;children&quot;; instead it contains a list of monikers to display to the user within a scrolling list.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
These are the following main list item objects:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<CODE>
GenItem<BR>
</CODE>
Objects used as entries in a GenItemGroup. In OSF/Motif, these objects appear in most cases as &quot;diamond&quot; settings.</LI>
<LI>
<CODE>
GenBoolean<BR>
</CODE>
Objects used as entries in a GenBooleanGroup representing true or false states. In OSF/Motif, these items appear most often as selectable &quot;boxes.&quot;</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The GenDynamicList does not specify any generic children, but instead will contain a list of visual monikers to cycle through a scrolling list.</P>
