<P>
In some cases, geometry constraints interfere with functionality. For example, you may wish for &quot;nested&quot; GenItemGroup behavior. Each main selection should act as an exclusive selection within the GenItemGroup, but it should also allow other generic objects &quot;in-between&quot; these exclusive items. Normal geometry constraints prevent this, as GenItemGroups may only contain GenItems as children.</P>
<P>
To enable this, you may set up each main section as a separate GenItemGroup with a single selection. Within each GenItemGroup, include a link to the next GenItemGroup with <CODE>
ATTR_GEN_ITEM_GROUP_LINK</CODE>
. Links should be circular; i.e., if three GenItemGroups should be linked, the first group should point to the second, the second to the third, and the third back to the first. The three linked GenItemGroups will act as one entity. If each GenItemGroup is exclusive, one group will select its single item child if selected and the other groups will deselect their children. </P>
<P>
These links work because you are allowed to &quot;select&quot; items that are not actually within a GenItemGroup. If an item not within the group is selected, any current selection will therefore be de-selected.</P>
