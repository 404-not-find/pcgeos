<P>
A large portion of the text library is devoted to input management and interaction with the UI and the user. Almost every input and display function for text is implemented within the text library, relieving your applications from containing often complex code. In almost all cases, you will not need to know how input is transferred to your text objects. </P>
<P>
The text library handles all keyboard and mouse input to text fields, interacting intelligently with the UI to process input events. (This includes pen input supported by the input manager and the pen input mechanisms.) Selection with the mouse and keyboard is handled automatically, as are quick-transfer operations.</P>
<P>
Because the text objects understand the focus and target hierarchies of the UI, they can interact directly with the controller objects. Applications using the text objects don't even have to know when a user has applied a new style, changed the paragraph spacing, or set the text color. The user can select text, call up the Style menu, and apply a new style without using a line of application-specific code. If you wish such behavior to happen automatically, you should mark your text object GA_TARGETABLE in its GI_<CODE>
attrs</CODE>
 instance field.</P>
<P>
GEOS also provides filters to text objects; these filters allow the text object to selectively intercept and process text as it is being added to a text object (usually a GenText), either from direct keyboard typing or from a more complex operation (such as a clipboard paste). Filters allow the text object to accept or reject text on a number of bases (such as character by character). </P>
