<P>
As with several other major features of the GEOS user interface, the text library has associated controller classes for many features. Because text formatting has so many options and choices for the user, providing the menus, dialog boxes, and choices can be a lot of work for an application. The text controller objects, however, remove nearly all this work while allowing applications the full support they require.</P>
<P>
Nearly every feature of the text library has one corresponding controller object. In addition, master controllers exist to manage other controller objects. Therefore, if you use a master controller, other controllers that may be added to the text object (by Geoworks) will be automatically included in your geode without changing the source code or recompiling.</P>
<P>
Using controllers and an editable text object, you can actually create a simple but full-featured word processor without writing any code other than UI object definitions. Controllers typically work on both GenText or VisText objects; whichever text object has the target will receive updates from controllers.</P>
