<P>
The TicTac sample application is extremely simple. It draws a Tic Tac Toe board and its outline, and it has ten pieces which the user can move. Five of these pieces are gray squares, and five are gray circles. Each of the pieces may be moved by clicking and dragging it with the mouse. Any piece may be moved anywhere on the board, but pieces may not be moved off the board.</P>
<P>
A Game menu with a &quot;New Game&quot; trigger replaces all the pieces to their original locations. Because this is a simple example, no actual rules of any kind are enforced. Recognition of winning sequences and rules involving turn sequencing or playing against the computer are left as exercises for the reader.</P>
