<P>
There are four base visible classes on which the other object libraries are founded. <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 is the most basic and at the root of the visible class tree. Under it are <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
 and <CODE>
VisTextClass</CODE>
. <CODE>
VisContentClass</CODE>
 is a subclass of <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
.</P>
<P>
<CODE>
VisTextClass</CODE>
 is special in that it is rarely subclassed as it already contains nearly all the functionality an application will need from a visible text object.</P>
<P>
The other three classes are typically subclassed by applications. None of the three can draw itself; instead, the subclass must handle <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW</CODE>
, the message that indicates the object must draw itself. The three different classes are used as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<CODE>
VisClass<BR>
VisClass</CODE>
<A NAME="IX_VisClass:overview">
 </A>
 is the head of the visible class tree and therefore is the most broad-based in functionality. <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 objects can not have children and therefore can only exist as the leaves of the object tree.</LI>
<LI>
<CODE>
VisCompClass<BR>
VisCompClass</CODE>
<A NAME="IX_VisCompClass:overview">
 </A>
 provides a composite <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 object. Essentially, this class is the same as <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 except that it can have children. It also includes several special geometry options that allow it to manage and place its children as well as set their bounds.</LI>
<LI>
<CODE>
VisContentClass<BR>
VisContentClass</CODE>
 is used only as the content of a GenView. It is a subclass of <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
 and therefore can have children and manage them with the same geometry features available to VisComp. In addition, the VisContent interacts with the GenView to handle input and drawing. The content can interact with the view to determine sizing behavior as well as input behavior.</LI>
</UL>
