<P>
You can create a visible object tree either in your Goc source code or at run-time. As stated earlier, the visible tree is linked to the generic UI object tree through the GenView object. Without a view object, you will not be able to display your visible objects.</P>
<P>
The visible object tree must have a <CODE>
VisContentClass</CODE>
 object (or a subclass of <CODE>
VisContentClass</CODE>
) as its root object. If another class is chosen for the topmost object, that class will have to handle all the messages that would normally be received by a content; otherwise, results are unpredictable and your application will likely not function the way you expect.</P>
<P>
VisContent objects are rarely, if ever, used lower in the visible tree than as the top node. For levels further down in the tree, you can use <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
 (or, again, a subclass of <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
). VisComp allows the object to have children and does not incur the same amount of overhead associated with a VisContent. Any object in the visible tree that may have children must be a &quot;composite&quot; object, or a subclass of <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
.</P>
<P>
Leaf nodes of the visible tree can be direct subclasses of <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
. Objects of <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 can not have children, but they have all the attributes and instance data you need for a leaf node. You must subclass <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
, however, if your object is ever to be shown on the screen: Since visible objects can have any application-defined visible representation, you must write the <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW</CODE>
 handler yourself; this can be done only in a subclass.</P>
