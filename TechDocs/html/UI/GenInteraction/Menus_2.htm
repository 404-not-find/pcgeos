<P>
A sub-group Interaction is the simplest manifestation of a GenInteraction. A sub-group may only appear as part of a larger window. You will most often use sub-group Interactions to arrange and group other objects (the Interaction's children) within proper places in the UI. This grouping is also sometimes useful to perform geometry actions upon and otherwise manipulate a group of objects as a whole. Using Interactions eliminates the need to provide individual requirements to each child object.

<P>
For example, you can use the hint <CODE>
HINT_ORIENT_CHILDREN_VERTICALLY</CODE>
 on a single GenInteraction object to display its children in a vertical row. The Interaction's only function in this case is to provide an object for the hint to act upon. Interactions of this type may contain any number and type of children. Because they are not independently displayable, however, their use becomes limited to the constraints of the larger window. If you need the Interaction's children to be hidden from view until needed, you should use a popup or dialog Interaction.</P>
