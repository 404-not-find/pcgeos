<P>
A popup is an Interaction that you can use to contain commands or selections that should only be displayed when the popup itself is activated. A popup usually conceals its children from view until needed, therefore avoiding cluttering up the UI with dozens of objects at any given time. Popups are most often implemented as menus. Popups usually only remain on-screen until either a selection within the popup is made or the user activates some other object. Menus in OSF/Motif, for example, will only remain on-screen until an object in the menu is selected or until the user clicks somewhere else in the application. (GEOS' implementation of OSF/Motif does allow popups to be pinned, however.)

<P>
Popups are not independently displayable; they must appear as part of another window. The popup Interaction's visual moniker usually serves as the only visual cue to the existence of the menu until it is activated. These menu titles usually appear in an appropriate menu bar of the window.</P>
