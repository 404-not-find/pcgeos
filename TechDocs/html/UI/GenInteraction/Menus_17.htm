<P>
The Specific UI provides standard response triggers for certain <CODE>
GenInteractionType</CODE>
, when built as dialog boxes. These standard response triggers contain an appropriate <CODE>
InteractionCommand</CODE>
 and usually a visual moniker chosen by the Specific UI.</P>
<P>
The standard response triggers (and their visual monikers under OSF/Motif) for each GII<CODE>
_type</CODE>
 are shown in the figure below.
<IMG SRC="Menus_17_response.gif">

</P>
<P>
The Specific UI automatically places these standard response triggers in a reply bar within the dialog. In most cases, you will not have to deal directly with any of these standard response triggers; the Specific UI will create and manage them. In other cases, you must either supply additional response triggers or replace the existing default response triggers. Additional triggers must be supplied for GIT_COMMAND and GIT_MULTIPLE_RESPONSE Interactions. You may replace existing triggers to customize their behavior or even just to change their visual monikers.</P>
<P>
You should add <CODE>
HINT_SEEK_REPLY_BAR</CODE>
 to any additional triggers you supply so that they will be placed in the reply bar area of the Interaction (though this is not necessary). If you add more than one trigger, their order within the Interaction's children will be the order they appear in the reply bar. However, supplemental reply bar triggers will appear to the right of any IC_OK, IC_YES, IC_STOP, or IC_APPLY and to the left of any IC_DISMISS, IC_RESET, or IC_NO trigger.</P>
<P>
Certain triggers may act as default triggers in the reply bar. Default triggers do not need to be explicitly activated (i.e. clicked on) to send out their action. Default triggers may also be activated if the user performs a default activation (normally hitting &quot;Return&quot; or double-clicking on an object within the dialog). Normally this default activation trigger will be the first trigger in the reply bar. Default triggers may be highlighted in some manner by the Specific UI. You can override this behavior by marking any reply trigger of your choosing with the hint <CODE>
HINT_DEFAULT_DEFAULT_ACTION</CODE>
.</P>
<P>
The Specific UI gives <CODE>
HINT_DEFAULT_DEFAULT_ACTION</CODE>
 to the IC_APPLY, IC_OK and IC_YES triggers in any reply bars it creates. (These are normally the first triggers anyway.) For example, the &quot;OK&quot; trigger in a GIT_NOTIFICATION dialog may be activated by either clicking on the trigger or hitting RETURN.</P>
<P>
Whenever a dialog is initially brought on-screen, the trigger marked with HINT_DEFAULT_DEFAULT_ACTION will act as the default activation trigger. However, activating any other trigger will make that trigger the default activation trigger the next time the dialog is brought on-screen. You can avoid this by adding <CODE>
HINT_PREVENT_DEFAULT_OVERRIDES</CODE>
 on the GenInteraction itself. This will allow the <CODE>
HINT_DEFAULT_DEFAULT_ACTION</CODE>
 trigger to always remain the default trigger.</P>
