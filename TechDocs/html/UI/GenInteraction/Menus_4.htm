<P>
A dialog box is an Interaction that takes the form of an independently displayable window. Typically, a dialog box is a temporary window brought up by the application to request information from the user. Dialogs differ from Primary and Document windows in several ways, however. (For example, most dialogs are not resizable.)

<P>
A dialog box can be in either of two conditions: modal or non-modal. By default, dialog boxes are non-modal. A modal dialog box is one in which all other input to the application is blocked until the user responds to the dialog. You will usually need modal dialog boxes when an application must gain some further information before proceeding. For example, many of the System Preferences dialog boxes are modal to prevent the user from changing other aspects of the system while these dialogs are up.</P>
<P>
Dialog boxes come on-screen either through direct user activation or through the application's instigation. By default, a dialog box will usually have an associated trigger object placed within the UI. This trigger's only function is to allow the user to bring the dialog box on-screen. You may remove this default activation trigger if your application code should bring up the dialog box instead.</P>
