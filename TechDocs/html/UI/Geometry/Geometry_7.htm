<P>
Although child justification defaults to whatever the specific UI normally uses, you can set the justification of a composite's children with several different hints.</P>
<P>
Typically, horizontal composites will have their children top-justified and vertical composites will have left-justified children (as shown in the previous examples).</P>

<H2 CLASS="HeadingC">
Edge Justification</H2>
<PRE>HINT_TOP_JUSTIFY_CHILDREN, HINT_BOTTOM_JUSTIFY_CHILDREN, HINT_LEFT_JUSTIFY_CHILDREN, HINT_RIGHT_JUSTIFY_CHILDREN</PRE>
<P>
<A NAME="IX_HINT_RIGHT_JUSTIFY_CHILDREN">
 </A>
<A NAME="IX_HINT_LEFT_JUSTIFY_CHILDREN">
 </A>
<A NAME="IX_HINT_BOTTOM_JUSTIFY_CHILDREN">
 </A>
<A NAME="IX_HINT_TOP_JUSTIFY_CHILDREN">
 </A>
If you want to line all of a composite's children up on one of their edges, you should use one of these hints. They are self-explanatory; the edge specified in the name of the hint (top, left, etc.) is the edge of the composite along which all the children will appear.</P>
<P>
Add the justification hints along with an orientation hint. Examples of justification are shown in the figure below.

</P>


<H2 CLASS="HeadingC">
Edge Alignment with Other Objects</H2>
<PRE>HINT_ALIGN_LEFT_EDGE_WITH_OBJECT, HINT_ALIGN_TOP_EDGE_WITH_OBJECT, HINT_ALIGN_RIGHT_EDGE_WITH_OBJECT, HINT_ALIGN_BOTTOM_EDGE_WITH_OBJECT</PRE>
<P>
<A NAME="IX_HINT_ALIGN_BOTTOM_EDGE_WITH_OBJECT">
 </A>
<A NAME="IX_HINT_ALIGN_RIGHT_EDGE_WITH_OBJECT">
 </A>
<A NAME="IX_HINT_ALIGN_TOP_EDGE_WITH_OBJECT">
 </A>
<A NAME="IX_HINT_ALIGN_LEFT_EDGE_WITH_OBJECT">
 </A>
These hints align an object's respective edge with the same edge of another object; the optr of the other object is the hint's argument. The other object does not necessarily have to be a direct sibling or parent, but the result must not cause the object to stray outside its parent's bounds. </P>


<H2 CLASS="HeadingC">
Centering Children</H2>
<PRE>HINT_CENTER_CHILDREN_VERTICALLY, HINT_CENTER_CHILDREN_HORIZONTALLY</PRE>
<P>
<A NAME="IX_HINT_CENTER_CHILDREN_HORIZONTALLY">
 </A>
<A NAME="IX_HINT_CENTER_CHILDREN_VERTICALLY">
 </A>
Often, rather than justifying a composite's children, you will want to center them. These two hints allow you to center the children as shown in the figure below.

</P>


<H2 CLASS="HeadingC">
Full Justification</H2>
<PRE>HINT_FULL_JUSTIFY_CHILDREN_HORIZONTALLY, HINT_FULL_JUSTIFY_CHILDREN_VERTICALLY, HINT_DONT_FULL_JUSTIFY_CHILDREN, HINT_INCLUDE_ENDS_IN_CHILD_SPACING, HINT_DONT_INCLUDE_ENDS_IN_CHILD_SPACING</PRE>
<P>
Besides justifying the composite's children either on a single edge or on the center line of the composite, you might want to full-justify the children. To do this, you will want to give the composite an orientation first (either vertical or horizontal). The composite may also require a special sizing hint to expand its bounds--see <CODE>
HINT_EXPAND_WIDTH_TO_FIT_PARENT</CODE>
 and the other sizing hints in <A HREF="Geometry_8.htm#62333"> Sizing Objects</A>
.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IX_HINT_DONT_INCLUDE_ENDS_IN_CHILD_SPACING">
 </A>
<A NAME="IX_HINT_INCLUDE_ENDS_IN_CHILD_SPACING">
 </A>
<A NAME="IX_HINT_FULL_JUSTIFY_CHILDREN_VERTICALLY">
 </A>
<A NAME="IX_HINT_FULL_JUSTIFY_CHILDREN_HORIZONTALLY">
 </A>
If the full justification hint is in the same dimension as the orientation of the composite (e.g., <CODE>
HINT_FULL_JUSTIFY_CHILDREN_HORIZONTALLY</CODE>
 and <CODE>
HINT_ORIENT_CHILDREN_HORIZONTALLY</CODE>
), then the geometry manager will divide up the entire space of the composite and spread the children out equally along it. If you also specify <CODE>
HINT_INCLUDE_ENDS_IN_CHILD_SPACING</CODE>
, the geometry manager will calculate the spacing as if there were one more child than there actually is; it will then put half the extra space on either end of the children. HINT_DONT_INCLUDE_ENDS_IN_CHILD_SPACING performs the default calculations. Examples of various full justification are shown in the figure below. See <A HREF="Geometry_8.htm#17068"> Using Full Justification of Children</A>
 for the code required to implement this full justification behavior.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IX_HINT_DONT_FULL_JUSTIFY_CHILDREN">
 </A>
Typically, full justification is not implemented by default. Some specific UIs may try to full-justify children always; if you want the children non-justified (when possible), apply <CODE>
HINT_DONT_FULL_JUSTIFY_CHILDREN</CODE>
. Added spacing is also typically not turned on by default; you can ensure that added spacing will not be included (where possible) by applying the hint <CODE>
HINT_DONT_INCLUDE_ENDS_IN_CHILD_SPACING</CODE>
 to your composite.
