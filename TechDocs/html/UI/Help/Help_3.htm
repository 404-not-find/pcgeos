 help, like Normal Help, provides a full-featured help viewer. First Aid files are also organized by context, but the information is presented in a different format. Whereas Normal Help is organized around the structure of the application, First Aid is presented in a book format.</P>
<P>
When a user clicks the First Aid trigger, the help page for the proper context is displayed; this will typically be taken from the current Focus object (as in Standard Help). From there, the user may navigate throughout the help &quot;book&quot; via both hyperlinks in the text and three buttons at the top of the help window: Contents, Chapter, and Article. An illustration of the First Aid help box is shown below.</P>
<P>
To use First Aid, an application needs its own HelpControl object. Simply add one as a child of your GenApplication and set its help type to <CODE>
HT_FIRST_AID</CODE>
. The help controller must also be put on the application's active list.
