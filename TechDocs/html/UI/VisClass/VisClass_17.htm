The first issue with large documents is the basic structure of the visible tree. The topmost object of a large visible tree must be able to keep track of information about the current translations and coordinates being used. Typically, the topmost object would be a subclass of <CODE>
VisContentClass</CODE>
; this does not change with large trees, though another consideration has to be taken care of.</P>
<P>
A content object should not contain any information about the document itself; the content object should not be stored along with other document information. Thus, the object that acts as the content can not be the object that also manages the 32-bit document space. Instead, it is easiest to use a <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
 object to manage the document space and to place this object as a child of the content.

<P>
In addition, you can set up several different composite children of the content, each one managing its own large document space. Each one of these composites is called a &quot;layer object&quot; and manages a &quot;layer&quot; of the document. This way, you can have several different layers (such as a spreadsheet layer and a graphic layer) in the same document. The layer object should manage the calculations and translations necessary for supporting the large document space.</P>
