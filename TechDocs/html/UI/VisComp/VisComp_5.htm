<P>
Every visible object has a window associated with it in which it will be drawn. Normal <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 objects have no control over what window they're associated with; they must be in the same window as their composite parents. Composites may need to appear in different windows from their parents, however.<A NAME="IX_VCI_window">
 </A>
 Thus, <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
 has the <CODE>
VCI_window</CODE>
 field, which contains the window handle of the window in which the composite's branch will be drawn.</P>
<P>
Applications will not access this field directly. Typically, composites will be drawn in the window associated with their parent composites or contents. Sometimes, however, an application will want a visible branch to appear in a window different from that of the rest of the visible tree. The composite then must use other <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 messages for creating and associating a window. This process is discussed in more detail in <A HREF="VisComp_b.htm#13783"> Managing Graphic Windows</A>
