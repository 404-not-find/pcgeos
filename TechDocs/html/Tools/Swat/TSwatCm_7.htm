<A NAME="IX_Swat:attaching and detaching">
 </A>
This group of commands controls the state of the connection between Swat and GEOS when Swat is running. The <CODE>
attach</CODE>
 and <CODE>
att</CODE>
 commands are used to establish the connection while <CODE>
detach</CODE>
 and <CODE>
quit</CODE>
 are used to sever it. The most frequently used commands in this group are <CODE>
att</CODE>
 with the <CODE>
-r</CODE>
 flag and <CODE>
detach</CODE>
. Some related commands contained in the Reference are <CODE>
go</CODE>
, <CODE>
istep</CODE>
, <CODE>
sstep</CODE>
, and <CODE>
next</CODE>
.</P>
<P>
The following is a typical but simplified debugging cycle using <CODE>
detach</CODE>
 and <CODE>
att</CODE>
. It assumes you have already attached for the first time.</P>
<UL>
<LI>
When a bug is encountered, determine where and what the bug is, then detach Swat by typing <CODE>
detach</CODE>
.</LI>
<LI>
Edit the application to fix the bug, recompile it and download it to the target machine.</LI>
<LI>
Re-attach Swat to the target PC using the <CODE>
att</CODE>
 command by typing Scrolllock-Shift-s on the target machine and typing <CODE>
att </CODE>
on the host machine.</LI>
<LI>
Continue debugging the application.</LI>
<LI>
Repeat the detach, edit, attach, debug cycle until all of the bugs are fixed.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
By themselves, the commands shown below can not do much except open and close the communication lines between GEOS and Swat. More commands to examine and modify the application's code as it runs are needed to start actual debugging.</P>

<P CLASS="figCaption">
In this example, we use the <CODE>
det cont</CODE>
 command so that GEOS will keep running. We then re-attach with <CODE>
att</CODE>
. In the intervening time, the two machines are independent, and the serial line is unused. We could have taken advantage of this to send down a new copy of some application (as long as that application was not running on the target machine).</P>

<PRE CLASS="syntax">att </PRE>
<P>
<A NAME="IX_att Swat command">
 </A>
The <CODE>
att</CODE>
 command is similar to the <CODE>
attach</CODE>
 command, but has no bootstrap argument (as explained below).</P>


<H2 CLASS="refHeading">
attach</H2>
<PRE CLASS="Ref Swat Call">attach [(+b|-b)]</PRE>
<P>
<A NAME="IX_attach Swat command">
 </A>
This command is used to attach Swat to the target PC when the Swat stub is already invoked. The<CODE>
 -b</CODE>
 argument is to bootstrap and the <CODE>
+b</CODE>
 argument is not to bootstrap. Bootstrapping means that Swat will search for the symbol files of all of the geodes and threads as they are encountered rather than all at the beginning. This saves some time if you've just detached and need to re-attach, using only a few geodes while debugging. If no argument is given, the most recent bootstrap setting is used. The default bootstrap setting is <CODE>
+b</CODE>
.</P>

<A NAME="IX_Errors:continuing after in Swat">
 </A>
cont</H2>
<PRE CLASS="Ref Swat Call">cont</PRE>
<P>
<A NAME="IX_cont Swat command">
 </A>
The <CODE>
cont</CODE>
 command continues the execution of GEOS after it has been stopped for some reason such as at a breakpoint or fatal error or by control-C. This command is often aliased as the letter <CODE>
c</CODE>
.</P>


<H2 CLASS="refHeading">
detach</H2>
<PRE CLASS="Ref Swat Call">detach [(cont|leave)]</PRE>
<P>
<A NAME="IX_detach Swat command">
 </A>
The <CODE>
detach</CODE>
 command will detach Swat from the target PC. By itself, the <CODE>
detach</CODE>
 command will detach Swat and exit GEOS. This command is usually used after a bug is encountered and the source code needs to be modified and recompiled (see <A HREF="TSwatCm_7.htm#35685"> Detaching and Attaching</A>
).</P>
<DL>
<DT>
<STRONG>
cont</STRONG>
</DT><DD>The <CODE>
cont</CODE>
 option will just detach Swat and allow GEOS to continue to run normally. This option is used when the debugging process is finished but GEOS is still needed to do other things (such as word processing) and you may need to re-attach later for further debugging.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
leave</STRONG>
</DT><DD>The <CODE>
leave</CODE>
 option will detach Swat but keep GEOS stopped wherever it was when the <CODE>
detach leave</CODE>
 command was given. This command is useful for passing debugging control to someone remotely logged in to the workstation or when Swat can not continue for some reason.</DD>


</DL>
<H2 CLASS="refHeading">
quit</H2>
<PRE CLASS="Ref Swat Call">quit [(cont|leave)]</PRE>
<P>
<A NAME="IX_quit Swat command">
 </A>
The <CODE>
quit</CODE>
 command is only used when Swat needs to be exited for good. It will detach Swat (if necessary), exit from Swat on the development station, and exit from GEOS.</P>
<DL>
<DT>
<STRONG>
cont</STRONG>
</DT><DD>The <CODE>
cont</CODE>
 option exits Swat on the development station but allows GEOS to continue running normally on the target PC. This option is used when the debugging process is finished but GEOS is still needed to do other things such as word processing.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
leave</STRONG>
<CODE>
</DT><DD></CODE>
The <CODE>

Ctrl-C</H2>
<PRE CLASS="Ref Swat Call">Ctrl-C</PRE>
<P>
<A NAME="IX_Control-c:in Swat">
 </A>
<A NAME="IX_Ctrl-c:in Swat[;C]">
 </A>
The <CODE>
Control-C</CODE>
 command is the command used to stop the execution of GEOS at any point. This command is executed by holding down the <CODE>
Ctrl</CODE>
 key and pressing the <CODE>
c</CODE>
 key. It is used to stop GEOS in order to set a breakpoint, examine memory, or to get a command line prompt.</P>
