<P>
Even after all the translations are complete, there may be a need to replace a certain executable with a newer version containing a bug fix or a feature enhancement. You will be able to do this quickly and effectively by using the Update feature in the File menu.</P>
<P>
To make this feature work, you must first put the updated geode and .vm file in the proper source directory, overwriting the original files. Then, by clicking Update Translation File (in the Update submenu of the File menu), the existing Translation File will be compared with the new strings in the geode, showing the new or changed chunks, as well as the ones left unchanged. The deleted chunks will be grouped in a separate resource named &quot;Deleted chunks&quot; at the end of the resource list. You will then be able to make the necessary modifications to this file to bring it up to date with the newest version of the geode.</P>
<P>
If the name of the original-language geode has changed, you will need to use the Update Geode Name function (in the Update submenu of the File menu) to tell ResEdit about the new name.</P>
<P>
After updating the Translation File, you can then create an updated local-language executable as out lined above. </P>
<P>
If there have been no changes to the geode that affect editable chunks (as when code changes for a bug fix), it is also possible to simply rebuild the new geode from the existing Translation File by choosing Create A New Executable from the File menu. </P>
<P>
After viewing the updated Translation File and making any necessary changes, you can remove the updating information from the Translation File by choosing Commit the Update trigger from the File/Update menu. This will remove information which marks the chunks as &quot;new&quot; or &quot;changed&quot; as well as remove the Deleted Chunks resource.</P>
