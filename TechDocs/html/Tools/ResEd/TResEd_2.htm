<P>
Make sure that there are two GEOS installations on your computer: one to hold the original-language version, and one for the translated version. These are often referred to as the source directory and destination directory, respectively.</P>
<P>
You will need original-language versions of the geodes you will translate. These should reside in a directory under the source directory. Most applications will be in the WORLD directory. The localization file for each geode you'll translate should be in the same directory as its associated geode.</P>
<P>
You'll use ResEdit to generate a foreign-language version of the geode. ResEdit will place the translated geode in the destination directory, at the same relative position as the original language version. </P>
<P>
For example, you might have source directory D:\GEOS20.NC and destination directory D:\LATIN. Your original-language application, Connect 4, might reside in D:\GEOS20.NC\WORLD\GAMES. You'd need to copy CONNECT_.VM to D:\GEOS20.NC\WORLD\GAMES. When finished with translating, the resulting translated geode, perhaps named Connect IV, would appear in D:\LATIN\WORLD\GAMES.</P>
<P>
To specify the locations of the Source directory or the Destination directory, choose the appropriate item from the Project menu. The Destination directory should not be the same directory as the Source directory.</P>
