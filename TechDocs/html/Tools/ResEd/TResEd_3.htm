<P>
To create a localized version of your applications, you will need to translate only the applications, libraries, and drivers you have created. All Geoworks software will be translated by Geoworks. </P>
<P>
Most applications will use GEOS system libraries whose UI is visible from the application. For example, an application which includes spell checking will have a dialog box containing all the information about the spell checking operation which is included from the Spell library. If the Spell library is not translated, that UI will always appear in its original form. Your application will work with the Spell library, whether or not it has been translated.</P>
<P>
At this point you are ready to translate geodes into the target language. The following set of steps can be carried out by a non-programmer running the ResEdit tool. Of course, the translator should have a good idea of the geode's function and use.</P>
