<P>
In explaining how to use the Resource Editor, we use some vocabulary to describe certain operations and program constructs.</P>
<DL>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Geode, Executable</DT><DD>
</STRONG>
	A &quot;geode&quot; or &quot;executable&quot; is a GEOS program: a GEOS application, library, or driver.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Source Executable</DT><DD>
</STRONG>
	The original-language program.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Destination Executable</DT><DD>
</STRONG>
	The local-language executable, which is created by translating the source executable. </DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Resource</STRONG>
</DT><DD>Geodes are divided into memory blocks called resources. Resources may contain code that will be executed, data that will be referred to, or text and bitmaps which will be displayed to users. The Resource Editor will only allow you to edit those resources which contain strings or bitmaps. Each resource has a unique number or extended name.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Chunk</STRONG>
</DT><DD>Resources are, in turn, divided into chunks. Inside a resource, there are many different kind of chunks, each containing a unique piece of information, such as a text string, a bitmap, or an object structure. Each chunk has a unique number or name. Your translation will consist of new contents for these chunks.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Driver</STRONG>
</DT><DD>A driver is a special sort of executable that performs a very specific function that may not be needed by every user. Many drivers are responsible for interactions with particular kinds of hardware peripherals. In GEOS, there are DOS, video, mouse, communications, and printer drivers, along with a few other types. Most drivers are designed to work with more than one device. For example, the EPSON9.GEO printer driver actually supports more than 50 printers--if you were to localize the driver, you might need to translate the names of those printers.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Localization</STRONG>
 <STRONG>
File</DT><DD>
</STRONG>
	When a geode is created, an extra file to be used by the Resource Editor is created at the same time. This file (which is named like the .geo file but with a .vm extension) contains localization information about the resources and chunks which you will be editing. You cannot localize a geode without this file.</DD>
<DT>
</DT><DD>A programmer may create a localization file much as they would compile a geode. Using the GEOS SDK, issue the command &quot;pmake full&quot; to compile a Localization file in addition to a geode. </DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Translation</STRONG>
 <STRONG>
File</DT><DD>
</STRONG>
	The file that the Resource Editor creates is called a Translation File. The information stored in this file will be merged with the source executable to create the destination executable. Internally, the file holds a copy of the original-language text or bitmap, along with your translation and may contain some translation instructions.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Moniker</STRONG>
</DT><DD>Text or graphics which serves as the visual name for objects such as menu items, button labels, and dialog box options. E.g., the File menu's moniker is &quot;File&quot;; an OK button would have moniker &quot;OK&quot;.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Text String</STRONG>
</DT><DD>Text in the geode which is not a moniker.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Mnemonic</STRONG>
</DT><DD>A key that, when pressed with the Alt key, will activate a specific UI gadget which has this letter or symbol underlined in its moniker.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
GString</STRONG>
</DT><DD>Graphics string. This data structure is used for describing many types of graphics. Most application icons and document icons are GString Monikers.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Bitmap</STRONG>
</DT><DD>Bitmap image.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Keyboard Shortcut	</DT><DD>
</STRONG>
A combination of keystrokes than when pressed will cause an object to perform a specific action. Keyboard shortcuts are stored in the chunk containing the object to which they are connected.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Updating</STRONG>
</DT><DD>Unfortunately, software often changes. As you make changes to the original-language software, it might become necessary for you to take a Translation File you created with an older version of a particular geode and update it with the newer version. The newest software may contain new strings, may have modified existing strings, or may have eliminated some strings. The Resource Editor is however able to match these two executables and show the newest changes. The process of updating a file will be discussed in more detail later in these instructions.</DD>
