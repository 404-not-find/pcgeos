<P>
After all of the chunks and resources in the selected .vm file have been translated and saved in a Translation File, a new local-language executable can be created in the target installation. </P>
<P>
The first step to placing the new executable in the correct place is making sure that the localization target kit has been placed in another directory on your hard drive, for example C:\ESPANOL. </P>
<P>
Then select the Destination directory option from the Project menu. It will ask you to choose the top level GEOS directory that will hold the modified executables. In this case, you would choose the C: drive from the Drives list, and choose \ESPANOL in the scrolling list of directories. </P>
<P>
You need not have a full GEOS installation in the target directory. However, when new executables are created, they are placed into the same subdirectory as the original geode. For example, if you were to translate GeoWrite, which is in the WORLD directory, and you had the destination directory set to ESPANOL, the directory ESPANOL\WORLD must exist when you try to create the new executable. If it doesn't, then you will get an error message saying that the target could not be created.</P>
<P>
To create the translated geode, choose Create New Executable... from the File menu.</P>
<P>
This new geode will have the identical original-language long name as the original geode (unless you have changed the name in the File Menu's New Name and User Notes dialog). You may wish to rename several of the geodes, especially those in the WORLD directory and the Screen Savers, to reflect local-language names.If you change the name, the new geode will not overwrite the original one, and you will have to go back and delete the old one to avoid duplicates. </P>
