<P>
To begin creating new Translation Files, double click on the &quot;Res Edit&quot; icon in the Tools folder of the WORLD directory of the original-language version of Ensemble 2.0. </P>
<P>
This brings up a dialog box which gives you three choices:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Create New Translation File</LI>
<LI>
Open a Translation File</LI>
<LI>
Import an ASCII Translation File</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Choose the &quot;Create New&quot; option. Another dialog box appears, allowing you to select the localization (.vm) file for the geode you wish to edit. </P>
<P>
The first time you start the Resource Editor, it assumes you will be editing geodes in the GEOS20.NC directory, or whatever installation of GEOS you started in. Once you have a Translation File open, you can change the top-level directory by clicking on the &quot;Set source directory&quot; in the Project Menu. This setting is saved in your .ini file, so the next time you start ResEdit, it will automatically set the top-level source directory to what it was when exited.</P>
<P>
To create a new Translation File for a geode that is not in the GEOS20 installation (or whichever installation is currently set as the top-level source directory), change the top-level source directory first--because you cannot access the Project menu with no Translation File open, you may need to create a new Translation File and keep it around until you can access the Project menu to change the Source directory.</P>
