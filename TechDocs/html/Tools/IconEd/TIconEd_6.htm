<P>
This is the function that most people associate with an icon editor. The token database is a cache of moniker lists used by GeoManager and other applications. The token database exists so that every time an application's moniker is needed, it is not necessary to start the application in engine mode to request the moniker (a slow process). </P>
<P>
The icon editor can change entries in the token database. You cannot change the &quot;built in&quot; moniker for a geode using the icon editor. If you make changes to the token database and then delete the database, then when it gets rebuilt your monikers will no longer be there. </P>
<P>
Given that, it's still likely that people will want to set their own monikers in the token database; the icon editor has this ability. </P>
<P>
To change an entry:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Make sure you are editing the icon you wish to change.</LI>
<LI>
Open the File-&gt;Export to Token Database dialog.</LI>
<LI>
One of the icon's formats should be visible under the &quot;Change To:&quot; text in the dialog. If not, then you are probably editing the wrong icon, or perhaps the icon hasn't been saved into the database.</LI>
<LI>
Use the file selector to find the application, document, library, or other driver whose token database entry you wish to change. Otherwise, enter the four token characters for the geode into the Token Characters text field. Select the corresponding operation from the list at the lower-right of the dialog (&quot;Use File Selector&quot; or &quot;Use Token Chars.&quot;)</LI>
<LI>
The current token-db entry for the selected geode should appear under the &quot;Current Icon&quot; title at the upper-right corner of the dialog. </LI>
<LI>
When you are satisfied with the edited icon, change the moniker with the &quot;Change&quot; trigger in the dialog's reply bar. The change will not take effect in GeoManager until you select Disk-&gt;Rescan Drives in GeoManager.</LI>
<LI>
If you wish to revert a token-database entry to the original, built-in moniker for the geode, select the geode in the file selector and use the &quot;Remove&quot; trigger in the reply bar.</LI>
</UL>
