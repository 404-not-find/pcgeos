<P>
The icons produced by the icon editor are stored in an &quot;icon database&quot; so that they can be viewed and retrieved easily. The icon database is the Icon Editor's &quot;document&quot;, so New/Open, Close, Save As, Make Backup and other Document-control commands will operate on the current database. &quot;Save&quot; actually saves the currently edited icon into the current icon database, and saves the database as well. </P>
<P>
There are 3 standard kinds of icons in use in the system. Each standard type of icon has 3 default formats: One for VGA screens, one for MCGA (monochrome VGA) screens, and one for CGA screens.</P>
<P>
Most icons are used in one of the following ways:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
File Icons, which are used by GeoManager to display and launch applications. The sizes are 48x30, 48x30 (monochrome), 48x14, 32x20, and 32x20(monochrome).</LI>
<LI>
Tool Icons, which are used by controllers in their toolbox UI. The format sizes are 15x15 and 15x10.</LI>
<LI>
Mouse Pointers, which are used to provide a cursor tracking the mouse's movement. This format has one standard size:16 x 16.</LI>
<LI>
Icons which will appear in the OmniGo's Home Screen application are 16x16 and monochrome.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
You may also create custom icons, which start with 1 default format. Custom icons are limited to 1024 pixels wide or tall, and the formats cannot be larger than 64k. </P>
<P>
The first time the icon editor is started it will create a blank file icon named &quot;untitled.&quot; After that, if there is an icon database available to the icon editor, the icon editor will start with the last icon that was being edited before the editor was shut down. </P>
<P>
To create a new icon, choose &quot;Create New Icon&quot; from the Icon menu. The dialog will present 4 options for the type of icon. If you decide to create a custom icon, you should enter the height, width and color scheme for the icon in the provided fields. </P>
