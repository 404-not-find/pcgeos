The icon editor can work with more than one icon database at a time via the Multiple Document Interface standard. Each database has its own window, each window having four views. The leftmost view is the database. The top-right view is the &quot;Pixel View&quot;, the main editing area. The two remaining views are next to each other in the lower-right portion of the window. The left view is the actual-size view of the icon, and is editable. The right window is the format list, showing all formats of the icon currently being edited.</P>
<P>
Double-clicking an icon in the database viewer will select it for editing. The currently-edited icon is important in the following ways: </P>
<UL>
<LI>
It is (of course) the only icon being edited in the database associated with that window. </LI>
<LI>
Its size determines the shapes of the various views, which will try to adjust themselves to fit in the window as best they can.</LI>
<LI>
It is the icon that appears in the &quot;Preview&quot; dialog. </LI>
<LI>
It is the icon used in the &quot;Export to Token database&quot; dialog (explained below).</LI>
<LI>
It is the target of all operations in the Icon and Format menus (except &quot;create new icon&quot;).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The database viewer supports all clipboard operations except for Undo. Icons may be selected and moved or copied between databases. This can be done via the Edit menu or quick-transfer. </P>
<P>
The format list is used to switch editing to a different format in the same icon. This can only be done with the mouse. </P>
<P>
To get more room for editing, use the Options menu to temporarily hide the database viewer or format list while editing. </P>
