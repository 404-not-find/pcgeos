<P>
The Tool Command Language is abbreviated as Tcl and is pronounced &quot;tickle&quot;. It was developed and written by Professor John Ousterhout at the University of California at Berkeley. Tcl is a combination of two main parts: a language and a library.</P>
<DL>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Language</STRONG>
</DT><DD>The Tcl language is a textual language intended primarily for issuing commands to interactive programs such as text editors, illustrators, shells, and most importantly debuggers. It has a set syntax and is programmable, thus allowing users to create more powerful commands than the built-in command set listed in <A HREF="../../Tools/SwatRef/index.htm">the Swat Command Reference</A>.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Library</STRONG>
</DT><DD>Tcl also includes a library which can be imbedded in an application, as it is in Swat. This library includes a parser for the Tcl language, routines to implement the Tcl built-in commands, and procedures allowing an application to extend Tcl with additional commands.</DD>
