<A NAME="IX_Mkmf">
 </A>
The mkmf tool exists to create a file named MAKEFILE. The <CODE>
pmake</CODE>
 program will use this file as a sort of script, using it to determine how to compile and link the geode. However, makefiles can get rather complicated, so it is best to create them using mkmf instead of by hand.</P>
<P>
For information about customizing this boilerplate makefile, see <A HREF="TTools_10.htm#28191"> pmake</A>
.</P>
<P>
The mkmf tool uses the following rules to build the makefile:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
The geode name is taken from the name of the directory in which you run mkmf. Among other things, this means that if you change the name of your development directory, you should also run mkmf again.</LI>
<LI>
Any file in the current directory or its subdirectories will be considered a source file if it has one of the following suffixes: .asm, .def, .ui, .c, .h, .goc, or .goh (except that .c files which are generated from .goc files will not be considered sources).</LI>
<LI>
For each .asm, .c, or .goc file, an .obj file with corresponding name will be added to the makefile variable OBJS.</LI>
<LI>
If there are subdirectories, then each subdirectory is considered to hold the source for a <EM>
module</EM>
 of the program, and <CODE>
mkmf</CODE>
 will work with the files in this subdirectory as a unit. The module's name will be added to the CMODULES variable if it contains .c or .goc files; if it contains .asm files, then it will be added to the MODULES list. When using <CODE>
pmake</CODE>
, each module will be considered something that can be made, a sort of intermediate step towards making the whole geode. If you do not wish the files in a subdirectory to be incorporated in the program, create a file in the directory called NO_MKMF. This file need have no contents.</LI>
</UL>
