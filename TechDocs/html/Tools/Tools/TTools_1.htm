<P>
The tools provided in this kit are listed below. Each is described in full in the following sections.</P>
<DL>
<DT>
<STRONG>
pmake</STRONG>
 </DT><DD>&quot;Make&quot; utility which has knowledge of Goc. The <CODE>
pmake</CODE>
 tool manages geode compilation and linking, making appropriate calls to Goc and Glue.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Goc</STRONG>
 </DT><DD>C preprocessor which is aware of programming constructs specific to GEOS programming. The Goc tool looks for special keywords (such as @class and @object) and creates the proper GEOS data structures so that the geode will work correctly after being compiled and linked. Chances are you won't call Goc directly but will instead use <CODE>
pmake</CODE>
, which will call Goc in turn.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Esp</STRONG>
</DT><DD>Assembler with awareness of GEOS programming constructs. Also includes support for creating enumerated types, complicated records, and more. Chances are you won't call Esp directly but will instead use <CODE>
pmake</CODE>
, which will call Esp in turn.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Glue</STRONG>
</DT><DD>GEOS linker. This determines how the program's resources should be set up and how those resources can be relocated. It determines file offsets and how to access library functions. As with Goc, you probably won't call Glue directly but will instead use it through <CODE>
pmake</CODE>
.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
grev</STRONG>
 </DT><DD>Revision number generator. This is a handy utility for generating revision numbers for geodes, which may be used to keep track of library protocols. The <CODE>
pmake</CODE>
 program uses grev to keep track of incremental changes; if you make large changes to a geode at some point, you can use grev to modify your geode's revision file to reflect your changes.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
mkmf</STRONG>
 </DT><DD>Makefile maker. Creates a MAKEFILE which will in turn be used by <CODE>
pmake</CODE>
 to determine how to create the geode's files.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
pccom</STRONG>
 </DT><DD>Communication manager. Sets up communication over serial lines. This manages data transfer and protocols when sending files between machines or debugging.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
pcs</STRONG>
 </DT><DD>Geode downloader. Sends geodes from the development machine to their proper directory on the target machine.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
pcsend</STRONG>
 </DT><DD>File downloader. Sends an arbitrary file from the development machine to an arbitrary directory on the target machine.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
pcget</STRONG>
</DT><DD>File uploader. Retrieves an arbitrary file on the target machine, transferring it to any directory on the development machine.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Swat</STRONG>
 </DT><DD>GEOS debugger. This program runs on the development machine, monitoring GEOS programs running on the target machine.</DD>
