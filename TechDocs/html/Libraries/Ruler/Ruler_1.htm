<P>
Rulers are a &quot;must have&quot; feature for drawing programs or any geode concerned with layout-intensive tasks. By alerting the rulers to pointer events, the application may display marks in the ruler which track the mouse's position so that the user knows the exact mouse coordinates. The ruler library provides many more features to applications prepared to support those features:

<LI>
<A NAME="IX_Grids:provided by ruler library">
 </A>
Grids<BR>
The ruler's tick marks are of course drawn inside the ruler. However, the ruler can draw a grid over the main view so that the user may see where major units fall on the document directly.</LI>
<LI>
<A NAME="IX_Guidelines:provided by ruler library">
 </A>
Guides<BR>
While a regular grid is helpful, the user may want to set up guidelines to mark off areas important to a document's layout. These guides may appear both as marks on the ruler and lines across the main view itself.</LI>
<LI>
Mouse Constraints<BR>
The rulers can act as mouse constraint managers. The mouse location can snap to grid lines, guidelines, or lines at any angle through any point. </LI>
<LI>
Large Document Support<BR>
The rulers work with large (32-bit) documents. They respond correctly to large mouse and scrolling events. However, at this time there is no way using C to intercept the message by which the Ruler handles large pointer events.</LI>
<LI>
Controller Support<BR>
The ruler library includes a full suite of controller objects, including controllers for managing grids and guides.</LI>
