<P>
GEOS uses three basic types of input events. These three types make up all the events necessary for mouse, keyboard, and pen input. They are <EM>
Pointer events</EM>
, <EM>
Button events</EM>
, and <EM>
Keyboard events</EM>
.</P>
<P>
Pointer and Button events deal with mouse and pen input. Keyboard events provide keyboard key press information. Pointer and Button events are often referred to as &quot;mouse&quot; events and are dealt with together because most objects interested in one type will also be interested in the other.</P>
<P>
A Pointer event details motion of the mouse pointer. If the user moves the mouse, a <CODE>
MSG_META_MOUSE_PTR</CODE>
 will be generated by the Input Manager and sent to the proper application. The type of Pointer event (not always <CODE>
MSG_META_MOUSE_PTR</CODE>
) is affected by the current keyboard state, mouse state, and other context information.</P>
<P>
A Button event details the press or release of a particular mouse button. Because different Specific UIs have different meanings for each mouse button, the function of the button determines which message is sent out. In the OSF/Motif specific UI, the left mouse button is used for selection; therefore, presses on that button cause <CODE>
MSG_META_START_SELECT</CODE>
, and releases cause <CODE>
MSG_META_END_SELECT</CODE>
. The exact message sent out, like Pointer events, can also be affected by input state information.</P>
<P>
Mouse events also carry with them several flags indicating various statistics about the event: whether the click is actually a double-click, whether any keys on the keyboard are being held down, etc.</P>
<P>
A Keyboard event details the press or release of a particular key on the user's keyboard. Usually, objects interested in Keyboard events will only be interested in presses and can ignore releases. <CODE>
MSG_META_KBD_CHAR</CODE>
 is the basic Keyboard event, and it carries flags detailing the state of the various modifier keys (e.g., Shift, Ctrl, Alt, NumLock). This message is always sent to the current focus.</P>
<P>
Pen input comes in the form of a special data structure called <CODE>
Ink</CODE>
. Ink input is instigated in the same manner as Button events, but it is handled in a completely separate manner. An object expecting Ink input must be aware when Ink events are being passed as opposed to normal mouse events. Special flags are used for this; see <A HREF="Input_e.htm#16857"> Pen Input and Ink</A>
