<P>
In order for an application to support the quick-transfer mechanism, it must be able to handle several situations. The list below enumerates all the tasks the application must be ready to perform:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Recognize initiation of a move/copy operation<BR>
When the user initiates a quick-transfer, the object under the mouse pointer will be notified the operation has begun.</LI>
<LI>
Provide feedback<BR>
Once a quick-transfer is initiated, every object on the screen becomes a potential destination for the transfer. When the mouse pointer moves over an object, that object must indicate what type of operation can be supported, if any.</LI>
<LI>
Receive the transfer item<BR>
If the move/copy operation is completed by the user when the mouse pointer is over an object, that object must be able to receive the item and provide feedback to the UI about the status of the quick-transfer.</LI>
<LI>
Recognize completion of the operation<BR>
When a quick-transfer is completed, the source object is notified and informed what type of operation took place.</LI>
<LI>
Shut off quick-transfer feedback on shutdown<BR>
When an object that can handle quick-transfers is shut down or destroyed, it must remove itself from the quick-transfer notification list. This takes care of any potential synchronization problems between object shutdown and the quick-transfer mechanism.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Applications should also understand the three rules that govern the behavior of a quick-transfer:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Transfers within a single document default to move operations.</LI>
<LI>
Transfers across documents default to copy operations.</LI>
<LI>
Transfers in a format not supported by the destination are &quot;no operation&quot; transfers.</LI>
</UL>
