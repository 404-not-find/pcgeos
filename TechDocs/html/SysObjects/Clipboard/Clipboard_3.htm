<P>
The user can copy and move selected items without using the Edit menu; he simply drags the item using the quick-transfer button of his mouse, and the item will be either copied or moved.</P>
<P>
There are several rules which govern whether a move or copy is taking place. The user can override these rules with a certain set of keypresses to force either a copy or move. Copy is equivalent to using the <EM>
Copy</EM>
 and <EM>
Paste</EM>
 functions in succession, and move is equivalent to using the <EM>
Cut</EM>
 and <EM>
Paste</EM>
 functions in succession.</P>
<P>
The operation of a quick transfer (move or copy), however, depends on whether the transfer is across documents or internal to a single document. If the transfer is internal, it should become a move. If the transfer occurs across documents, it should become a copy. (Note that, for the purposes of quick-transfer, the term <EM>
document</EM>
 is used to refer to anything the user will conceptually view as a single data holder--for example, a GeoManager &quot;document&quot; consists of one disk.)</P>
<P>
Because not all documents will support a given transfer operation (for example, a text file editor can not receive a GeoDraw graphic), the user is provided with immediate feedback about the type and validity of the transfer.</P>
<P>
For example, if a GeoDraw ellipse was selected and a quick-transfer was begun, immediately the mouse pointer would show the transfer as a move operation. As the user moves the mouse outside the GeoDraw document and into another GeoDraw document, the cursor changes to indicate a copy operation. If the user then moves the mouse over a text-only document, a &quot;no operation,&quot; or &quot;invalid,&quot; cursor would be shown, indicating that the ellipse could not be received.</P>
<P>
Some applications may implement an additional feature that provides feedback to the user: modifying the source object as the type of transfer changes. For example, a drawing program may wish to alter the shape or color of an object while it is being quick-moved but leave it normal during a quick-copy or no-operation transfer.</P>
