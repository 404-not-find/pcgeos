Controller objects provide the following features and benefits to application and library programmers:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Ease of use<BR>
Controllers are intended to be &quot;plug-and-play&quot; objects. Programmers simply include the controller to get all the appropriate UI gadgetry.</LI>
<LI>
Consistency of appearance<BR>
All applications that use a particular controller will appear consistent to the user. The controller knows the appropriate structure of its menus and dialogs, and all such controllers will appear the same to the user, increasing the application's ease of use.</LI>
<LI>
Automatic tool management<BR>
By using controllers along with a GenToolControl object, an application can allow the user to configure his own tool set. Controllers can have their UI placed along a display's edge, in the normal menus, or in a floating tool box; the GenToolControl allows users to decide where the tools will appear without affecting the application at all.</LI>
<LI>
Extendability of features<BR>
Any application that uses a controller can automatically include future features of a library. For example, if the GenView object were upgraded in the future to allow new features, the GenViewControl object would likely also be updated. Any application including the GenViewControl would automatically get the new UI and features without recompilation. Applications that do not use controllers will not automatically gain the benefits of upgraded libraries.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The GenControl is most useful for simple controllers. It is based on core UI objects (GenTrigger, GenInteraction, etc.) and is subclassed from <CODE>
GenInteractionClass</CODE>
. Applications that will have extremely complex controller-type functions may want to write their controllers from scratch--this is discussed in <A HREF="Controllers_9.htm#72863"> Creating Your Own Controllers</A>
