<A NAME="IX_Large document model:coordinates">

Some applications may need a graphics space larger than the 19 foot square of the standard coordinate space (10 foot square for printed documents). Some spreadsheets can take up a lot of room, as can wide banners. Geodes that will need a large drawing space can request a 32-bit graphics space. Most applications will be able to get by with standard 16-bit coordinate spaces, and their authors may safely skip this section. Note, however, that the Graphic and Spreadsheet objects use 32-bit graphics spaces for display.
<IMG SRC="Environment_c_bigRects.gif">

</P>
<P>
If a geode will use a 32-bit space in a view, it will need a VisContent object with the VCNA_LARGE_DOCUMENT_MODEL attribute.</P>
<P>
For the most part, 32-bit documents use the same graphics commands as regular 16-bit documents. No single drawing command can cover more than a standard document area; each has been optimized to draw quickly in 16 bits. To draw to the outlying reaches of your document space, apply a special translation that takes 32-bit coordinates, then use normal drawing routines in your new location. </P>
<P>
A model for working with 32-bit graphics spaces commonly used with spreadsheets is to break the graphics space into sections. To draw anything, the geode first uses a translation to get to the proper section, then makes the appropriate graphics calls to draw within that section. </P>
<P>
If you wish to display this 32-bit coordinate graphics space to the screen, you'll probably want to do so in a 32-bit content.</P>
<P>
The standard graphics commands can only draw to one 16 bit space at a time. You will need to translate the coordinate space to choose which 16-bit portion of the 32-bit space you want to draw to. To do so you need to use some special translation functions.<A NAME="IX_GrApplyTranslationDWord()">
 </A>
 <CODE>
GrApplyTranslationDWord()</CODE>
 corresponds to the <CODE>
GrApplyTranslation()</CODE>
 function normally used.You can use this routine to make the jumps necessary to access far away portions of the graphics space. Since a coordinate can now be in a much larger area than before, all routines that deal with a point's position have 32-bit equivalents.
