Every GEOS application and library will have at least two files: The Geode Parameters file provides the Glue linker with necessary information about the geode being compiled and linked. The source file contains the source code. Source code files may be split up into modules of source and definition files--this allows the programmer to keep large applications in a series of smaller files for easy organization and easier debugging.</P>
<P>
Essentially there are four different types of files your application may use:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Parameters File (<STRONG CLASS="fileName">
.gp</STRONG>
)<BR>
<A NAME="IX_.gp files:overview[;gp files:overview]">
 </A>
<A NAME="IX_.gp files">
 </A>
The Parameters file, as stated above, provides the Glue linker with necessary information. It details specifics about the geode being compiled that will be necessary for dynamically linking at runtime. Each geode may have only one Parameters file. The Parameters file for Hello World is detailed in <A HREF="HelloWorld_6.htm#81316"> Geode Parameters File</A>
. Full reference information for this file type can be found in the Routines reference book.</LI>
<LI>
Source File (<STRONG CLASS="fileName">
.goc</STRONG>
)<BR>
<A NAME="IX_Source code:overview">
 </A>
<A NAME="IX_.goc files">
 </A>
The Source file contains a combination of GEOS UI code and standard C code. Many source code files can be used for a single geode; this can help you organize your application's functionality into manageable groups of routines and objects. An introduction to the basics of the source file is given in <A HREF="HelloWorld_7.htm#77301"> The Source File and Source Code</A>
.</LI>
<LI>
C Header File (<STRONG CLASS="fileName">
.h</STRONG>
)<BR>
<A NAME="IX_Header files">
 </A>
<A NAME="IX_Header files">
 </A>
<A NAME="IX_.h files">
 </A>
C Header files may be used to hold definitions of data structures, classes, macros, routines, and other items. There are several standard GEOS header files you must include in your geode for it to compile properly. These are outlined in <A HREF="HelloWorld_7.htm#77301"> The Source File and Source Code</A>
.</LI>
<LI>
GEOS Header File (<STRONG CLASS="fileName">
.goh</STRONG>
)<BR>
<A NAME="IX_Header files">
 </A>
<A NAME="IX_Header files">
 </A>
<A NAME="IX_.goh files">
 </A>
This file is essentially the same as the C header files described above. It can contain class and routine definitions as well as constants and variables. The primary difference between these files and the C header files is that <STRONG CLASS="fileName">
.goh</STRONG>
 files must be included before the geode is run through the Goc preprocessor. C header files do not have to go through the Goc preprocessor. Simple geodes might have none of their own header files. These files are also described in <A HREF="HelloWorld_7.htm#77301"> The Source File and Source Code</A>
