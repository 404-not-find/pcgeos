<A NAME="IX_Text:objects">
 </A>
Text in GEOS is handled by the Text Object, a sophisticated and powerful object that is the base for both the GenText and the VisText classes. The Text Object handles more situations than most applications will ever face; only powerful word processors and text-formatting programs may require more functionality. Those that require additional features can subclass the text object and add those features.</P>
<P>
The Text Object implements text editing, manipulation, and display for GEOS. It represents a major portion of the system software and as such should be used by all applications that plan on providing any text-editing features. Among its many features are</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Display and Text Wrapping Within Editable Bounds<BR>
The Text Object is aware of its visible bounds and will wrap text appropriately to fit within the bounds. If the Text Object is given a set width, it will wrap text appropriately to that width.</LI>
<LI>
&quot;Editable&quot; and &quot;Selectable&quot; Attributes<BR>
The Text Object allows users to select and edit text. It can also act as a display-only object or a display-with-select object.</LI>
<LI>
Character and Paragraph Formatting<BR>
Sophisticated and extensive formatting options are included with the Text Object such as: Font selection, text styles (underline, bold, italic, etc.), text size (from four to 792 points), adjustable track kerning, text color, justification, adjustable margins, tabs with settable features (such as leaders, lines, and justification), paragraph borders, paragraph background colors, and paragraph spacing. All of these formatting options are settable and changeable.</LI>
<LI>
Full Keyboard Editing<BR>
The Text Object implements all the features necessary for editing text with the keyboard.</LI>
<LI>
Embedded Graphics<BR>
The Text Object can hold embedded graphics and graphics strings and display them properly.</LI>
<LI>
Support for the Clipboard and Quick-Transfer<BR>
The Text Object automatically supports the quick-transfer mechanism of the UI and handles the cut, copy, and paste commands of the Edit menu.</LI>
<LI>
Many other powerful features<BR>
For full feature listings and how to use the text object, see <A HREF="../../UI/Text/index.htm">the Text chapter</A>.</LI></UL>
