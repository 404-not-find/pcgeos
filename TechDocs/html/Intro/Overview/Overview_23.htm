GEOS<A NAME="IX_Spooler">

<A NAME="IX_Printing">
 </A>
 contains a print spooler that manages printing for all applications in the system. The spooler executes in its own threads and manages a print output queue for each printer connected to the system. The spooler also provides standard user interface components such as the print dialog box. Applications can customize the print dialog box by adding their own gadgetry for certain types of printing (such as the customizations in GeoDex and GeoPlanner).</P>
<P>
For the application, printing is essentially the same task as drawing to the screen; all the same graphics commands are used. The only difference is that the output is sent to a spool file rather than to the screen.</P>
<P>
If the paper size in a user's printer is different from the size of the document being printed, the spooler will do all the calculations and operations necessary to print the document properly. For example, a document eleven inches by seventeen inches will be rotated and printed on two standard-sized sheets of paper.</P>
