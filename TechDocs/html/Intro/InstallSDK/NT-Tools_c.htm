<P>
Every device that runs GEOS contains a specific version of the kernel, applications, and various ancillary libraries and drivers. The directory path that contains the specific version of the device software is called a Branch. (The &quot;Trunk&quot; is a collection of all the files from all the different branches. As a developer, you will never need to utilize any files on the Trunk.)</P>
<P>
Branch directories are located directly under the PCGEOS directory (<EM>
i.e.</EM>
, the main SDK directory) and were developed as a way to &quot;lock in&quot; a device-specific image of the development system. For example, the N9000V20 branch contains all the header and symbol files for Version 2.0 of the Nokia 9000 SDK.  When you install an SDK for another GEOS device, you will find a new branch directory specific to that device under the PCGEOS directory.</P>
<P>
The figure below
 shows the directory layout of the Nokia 9000i SDK (Version 1.1). This may appear slightly different on newer SDKs. This directory tree contains two Branch directories:  <EM>
N9000V11</EM>
 and <EM>
{Working_Branch}</EM>
.  ({<EM>
Working_Branch</EM>
} is your personal development area; see <A HREF="NT-Tools_f.htm#76945"> Developing In Your Working Branch</A>
 for a complete explanation of Working Branches)
<P>

<P>
If multiple developers are working on a project, then the branches should be separated into the local branches which reside on each engineer's machine and the shared network branch which all the project developers will access each time they compile. When performing a <STRONG>server</STRONG> install, the above directories marked &quot;shared/network&quot; are installed onto the network machine, and the <STRONG>client</STRONG> install places the directories marked &quot;local&quot; on each developer's machine. (See <A HREF = "NT-Tools_10.htm">5.5 Multi-Developer Projects</A>.)
