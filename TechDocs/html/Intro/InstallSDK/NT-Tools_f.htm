<P>
The Working Branch is your private development area. By doing all your work in your Working Branch (also called your <EM>
Local Root</EM>
), the Branch files can remain untouched.</P>
<P>
You specify the directory for your Working Branch during the Local SDK Install program.  The default is your login name.  For example, if your login is jdoe, then your Working Branch directory is <STRONG CLASS="fileName">
c:\pcgeos\jdoe\</STRONG>.</P>
<P>
Within your Working directory is a file called BRANCH.  This file specifies which Branch directory the tools will use when compiling and linking your source code.  The tools will first look for files in your Working Branch.  Whatever files it does not find in your Working Branch, it will look for in the Branch specified by the BRANCH file.  You need only keep the file or files that you are working on in your Working Branch and system files (such as header files) can remain on the device Branch. So, for example, a typical development sequence might look like this:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
You want to add another feature to the Zippy driver so you copy (or &quot;check out&quot; if you have a version control system) the zippy.goc file from the Branch to your Working Branch.</LI>
<LI>
You edit the file and make your changes.</LI>
<LI>
You compile the modified file.</LI>
<LI>
You find and fix all the bugs.</LI>
<LI>
You &quot;install&quot; the modified file by using version control or by simply copying it back to the Branch.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
To specify which Branch the compiler and linker should use, place the name of the Branch directory in the BRANCH file.  (Currently, setting the Branch field in GEOS Setup only affects which branch Swat uses; you must edit the actual BRANCH file yourself.) Initially, your BRANCH file contains N9000V20.</P>
