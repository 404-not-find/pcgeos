<A NAME="IX_cell library">
 </A>
For some applications, it is natural to organize data in a two-dimensional array. The classic example of this is the spreadsheet, in which every entry (or <EM>
cell</EM>
) can be uniquely identified by two integers: the cell's row and its column.</P>
<P>
The cell library lets you arrange data this way. The cell library saves the cells as DB items in a VM file. It insulates the application from the actual DB mechanism, letting the application behave as if its data is stored in a two-dimensional array. The library also provides routines to sort the cells by row or by column and to apply a routine to every cell in a range of rows and/or columns.</P>
<P>
A collection of cells arranged into rows and columns is termed a <EM>
cell file</EM>
. Every cell file is contained in a VM file. There is often a one-to-one correspondence between cell files and the VM files which contain them. However, this correspondence is optional. There is nothing to stop an application from maintaining several distinct cell files in a single VM file.</P>
