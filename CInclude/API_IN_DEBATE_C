 *	This file contains the filenames of any Include files that are in

 *
 *	NOTHING should be added or removed from any of the other API* files
 *	without first having gone through this file, & been reviewed by
 *	the API approval committee.
 *
 *      In general, proposed additions to the API will not be approved until:
 *
 *              - There are "C" equivalents for asm def files (driver include
 *		  files excluded)
 *              - There is one or more sample applications appropriate for
 *                distribution to developers demonstrating how to use the API.
 *              - All code is complete, fully tested, & ready to ship
 *                (including "C" stubs)
 *              - The API is stable & will not be a problem to maintain
 *                backwards compatibility with in the future
 *              - There is adequate documentation in the source code,
 *                and particularly in the include files
 *		- There is technical documentation on the API appropriate
 *		  for distribution to developers (this almost certainly
 *		  means docs created by the Tech Docs group)
 *
 * 	TO MAKE A CHANGE:  Add the filename & proposed changes to the top
 *	of the file below.  If you are proposing new API, be sure to refer
 *	to any specification files that may exist on the network.  Install
 *	this file, then send mail to "api-approval," asking that the
 *	proposal be reviewed.
 *
 *	Once you've received a decision, add an entry to the bottom of this
 *	file listing what the resolution was, the date, & perhaps most 
 *	importantly, the thinking behind the decision.  Then:
 *
 *	- Update API_C
 *	- Update API, if there assembly versions of the API

Correct.

All of these files should be deleted at some point.

spoolInt.h		INTERNAL				4/7/94
INTERNAL, in case anyone ever wanted to call SpoolAddJob (instead of
using the PrintControlClass), or if someone wanted to write a print driver.
This file is not needed for applications to compile, but is needed for
print drivers to compile.
-Don
INTERNAL it is then, & I will put it in the new "API_DRIVER_C".

The Config library is documented to write preferences modules.
However, it is missing documentation for selecting drivers from a
scrolling list, because when we were documenting that, the API for
that part of the Config library was unstable and we were debating
releasing it at all.
So, yes, it's useful for writing Preference modules but it's not
complete.
