Where the heck are all the routines in this driver anyway?

/n/o/pcgeos/Driver/Printer/PrintCom
	-common print driver include files

/n/o/pcgeos/Driver/Printer/Ascii
	-ASCII only print drivers
	Diasy Wheels etc.

	Diablo

/n/o/pcgeos/Driver/Printer/HP
	-Hewlett Packard PCL print drivers (also includes the Canon CaPSL
	driver for some reason)

	Deskjet, Dj500c, Lbp, Pcl4, QuietJet

/n/o/pcgeos/Driver/Printer/DotMatrix
	-All the impact dot-matrix type printers and some ink-jets that
	share common code sets or similarities with them. 9, 24, and 48 pin
	types all reside here.

	Bchip9, Canon48, Citoh9, Diconix9, Eplx9, Epmx9, Eprx9, Epshi24,
	Epson24, Epson48, Epson9, Nec24, Oki9, Ppds24, Prop9, Propx24,
	Star9, and Tosh24

/n/o/pcgeos/Driver/Printer/PrintCom/Buffer
	- common buffer handling routines for print drivers.

/n/o/pcgeos/Driver/Printer/PrintCom/UI
	-all the UI for the print options dialog boxes in the different 
	drivers.

	uiOptions<n1>ASF<n2>Man<n3>Trac.ui - ui for setting up paper paths for
		a printer with n1 AutoSheetFeeders, n2 manual paths, and n3
		tractor feed paths.

	uiOptions<arg>ASF<printer>.ui - common ui for setting paper paths for
		the <printer> type devices with <arg> Auto Sheet Feed options.

	uiEval<arg>ASFSymbol.asm - Routines to take the ui input for setting
		the paper path and the Symbol set (ISO subs are set to PCC_USA)

	uiEval<arg>ASFCountry.asm - Routines to take the ui input for setting
		the paper path and the Country ISO subs. The symbol set is
		set to PSS_IBM437, which is also the Epson extended ASCII 
		symbol set. <arg> is the number of auto sheet feeders.

	uiGet<arg>.asm - common routines to get the optr of the print driver's
		ui and return it to the spooler.

/n/o/pcgeos/Driver/Printer/PrintCom/Job
	-job control include files. These are mostly to set initial conditions
	and paper control. Copy control for page printers is included in this
	directory.

	jobStart<arg>.asm - PrintStartJob routines for different printers.

	jobEnd<arg>.asm - PrintEndJob routines for different printers.

	jobPaper<arg>.asm - PrintSetPaperPath routines for different printers.

/n/o/pcgeos/Driver/Printer/PrintCom/Page
	- Page specific init and exit routines. These set the page length, and
	do Form Feeds based on the modes passed from the spooler.

/n/o/pcgeos/Driver/Printer/PrintCom/Stream
	-common routines to deal with the PC/GEOS stream driver. These are the
	actual output routines of the print drivers.

/n/o/pcgeos/Driver/Printer/PrintCom/Cursor
	 -common print driver include files (cursor routines)
	These are organized mostly as single routines to be included by the 
	common print driver cursor include files in the PrintCom directory.

	cursorCommon.asm - common cursor routines for all drivers

	cursorConvert<n>.asm - conversion routines to an from driver coord.
		system, where n=resolution of driver coordinates.

	cursorPrLineFeed<arg>.asm - Vertical cursor movement routine, where
		arg determines the type of control code used to move. Exe=
		do the movement, and Set=set the vertical index, and LF to
		move.

	cursorSetCursor<arg>.asm - SetCursor routine, where arg determines
		the method used to position the printhead in X. Abs=use an
		integer position, Space=use space characters to move to right,
		Tab=set a tab, and tab to right.
	
/n/o/pcgeos/Driver/Printer/PrintCom/Graphics
	-common print driver include files (graphics routines)
	These are organized mostly as single routines to be included by the 
	common print driver graphic include files in the PrintCom directory.
	
	graphics<n1>Pass<n2>x<n3>.asm - routine to support a graphic print
		mode, where n1=number of passes the printhead makes, n2=
		horizontal resolution, and n3=vertical resolution.

	graphics<n>Resolutions.asm - steering routine to support n resolutions.

	graphicsCommon.asm - common graphic routines for all drivers.

	graphics<printer>Common.asm - common graphic routines for all similar
		drivers.

	graphicsPrintSwath<n>.asm - top level graphic printing routine for n
		vertical resolution.

	graphicsPrintSwath<n1>To<n2>.asm - same as above except that the low 
		resolution mode has a different resolution. (only used for 
		proprinter 24 pin type drivers)

	-some special routines exist here for sending raster info to a
	specific printer, such as graphicsPCLTIFF.asm etc.

/n/o/pcgeos/Driver/Printer/PrintCom/Graphics/Rotate
	- rotate routines for the graphics<n1>Pass<n2>x<n3>.asm routines

	rotate<n1>pass<n2>.asm - rotate routine, where n1 describes the number
		of interleaves, and n2 is the number of scanlines in each. If 
		n1 is not present, then there is no interleave.

	rotate<n1>pass<n2>Back.asm - rotate routine, same as above except that
		bit 0 is the top.

/n/o/pcgeos/Driver/Printer/PrintCom/Text
	- common print driver include files (text routines)
        These are organized mostly as single routines to be included by the
        common print driver Text include files in the PrintCom directory.

/n/o/pcgeos/Driver/Printer/PrintCom/Text/Font
	- These are the PrinterFontInfo structures to be used in selecting a
	font during ASCII printing. Also included here are the LaserJet
	download font driver font manager routines.

/n/o/pcgeos/Driver/Printer/PrintCom/Styles
	- common print driver style setting an d info routines

	stylesSR<arg>.asm - style setting and resetting routines for <arg>
		style.

	stylesGet.asm - returns style info to caller.

	stylesSet.asm - calls the SR routines to set and reset the styles
		based on the tested style word.

	stylesTest.asm - checks the allowable and mandatory styles for this
		font in this printer, and returns a legalized style word.

/n/o/pcgeos/Driver/Printer/PrintCom/Color
	- common routines to deal with color in printing.

	colorGetFormat.asm - gets the format for the bitmap out of the 
		device-specific info resource.

	colorMapRGBToCMYK.asm - takes RGB inputs and maps them to ribbon colors
		for impact dot-matrix printers (used in ASCII Modes).

	colorSet.asm - raw color setting routine.

	colorSetNext<arg> - increment the color number and set the next color
		of <arg> colorspace in the printer.
