5/13/92:
These are just random notes about localizing this thing.

the PROMPT= must be completely in the lower-ascii set. It's unlikely to change
	in any case, but I figure it's best to note this. If there are any
	versions of DOS that use some envariable other than PROMPT to hold
	the command prompt string, it will require some code changes to
	make the nonts driver work.

the defaultPrompt must end with a null byte. most of the other strings don't.
