NetWare Driver Decisions
------------------------
7/14/92		We will not merge this driver into the NetWare FS driver,
		because 1) Adam and I are not sure that this is the right
		thing to do, and 2) we could always do it later if
		necessary.



talk about semaphores:
	This file contains code for the semaphore facilities provided
	by the Net library.

	IMPORTANT: see netware.def for information on some bugs in NetWare
	that relate to semaphores.

	See our SPEC document on why we also need to provide a higher-level
	interface to network-based semaphores.

	In addition to these bugs, there are some other reasons why we
	provide a higher-level interface to network semaphores for PC/GEOS
	applications:

		- NetWare semaphores can only have values up to 127, though
		it is rumored that their networks can have up to 2700 nodes,
		and who knows how many PC/GEOS processes could be on each...

		- We cannot use the NetWare "timed wait on semaphore"
		facility, because it would lock up our DOS machine while
		waiting. Therefore, we have to provide a means to poll for
		a server-based semaphore. (Plus, there is a bug relating
		to timed wait on semaphore: if your client reboots, the
		time does not reset properly. NetWare advises developers
		NOT to use timed waits.)

		- NetWare semaphores must be opened and closed before they
		can be used. Opens and Closes cannot be nested from the
		same connection (workstation), so we have to manage all open
		server-based semaphores for PC/GEOS applications, so that
		we only open a specific semaphore once, and close it for this
		workstation when all local users are done.
