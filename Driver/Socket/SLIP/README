This SLIP driver is designed to communicate with UNIX using TIA or over 
direct serial connection.

Using SLIP over a direct serial connection
-------------------------------------------

	Compile the SLIP driver without the TIA flag.
	Specify the serial port, baud and local address or your PC 
	in the INI file.  For INI strings, see /s/p/Installed/geosec.ini.

	If settings are not present, SLIP defaults to using com1,
	at a baud of 9600 with the local address of 192.0.2.1 (defined
	to be a "nothing" address).  

	The max SLIP frame size can also be set.  SLIP defaults to 576
	which is the minimum frame size SLIP is allowed to use.

	If the serial lurker will be used with SLIP, both SLIP and
	the lurker MUST be set to use the same baud rate.

Using SLIP with TIA
---------------------

Software required to use SLIP with TIA:
	Slip Info Application
	TIA
	SLIP Driver compiled with TIA flag (see local.mk)

PC setup:  
	Serial cable connected on Sparc
	Null modem

The SLIP driver uses a special file to login to the Sparc account.  To 
create this file, run the "Slip Info" application.  This needs to be
done before the SLIP driver can be used.  (Appl/SlipInfo)

Initializing connection to Sparc:

	SLIP on PC				Sparc
	-----------				-------
	<CR>			--->
				<---		... login:
	<login>			--->
				<---		... Password:
	<password>		---->
				<---		... <prompt>
	"tia"<CR>		---->


Modifications may need to be made on the Sparc to ensure that the Sparc
generates the appropriate responses expected by the SLIP driver.  The
SLIP driver expects the prompt to end with a "%".  If the prompt ends in
a different char, either the prompt can be changed or PROMPT_SYMBOL can 
be changed in slip.def.  If the login name appears in the prompt, SLIP can
be told to look for that instead of a particular symbol by defining 
LOGIN_NAME_IN_PROMPT (see local.mk).

Applications:
 	If connection appears to be over (expected a disconnect
	but never seemed to receive it) reset the connection. 
	This should be a user interface command because 
	TIA does not retransmit packets.  It appears to expect
	the serial connection to be reliable.
