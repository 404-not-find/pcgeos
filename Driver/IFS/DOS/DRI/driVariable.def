;			  WORKING VARIABLES
;
udata	segment

;
; realJFTSize -- the actual size of the JFT. We up the size recorded in the
;		 PSP under DR DOS, as it uses that value while looking through
;		 its file table to decide whether we're allowed to open another
;		 file, rather than examining the JFT and seeing if there are
;		 any free slots left.
;
realJFTSize	word

;
; handleTable -- pointer to the array of near pointers to FileHandle structures
;		 via which DR DOS manipulates files. An SFN in the JFT is an
;		 index into this table.
;
handleTable	fptr.nptr.FileHandle
