DESCRIPTION:
	This file contains constants that are of use to most (or some) of
	the screen drivers.  To enable the constants that are of
	particular use to a given driver, set one of the constants:
		DEF_EGA
		DEF_CGA
		DEF_HGC
		DEF_VGA
		DEF_MCGA
	to true (outside this file).

;	(in windows 3.0 -- the Logitech bus mouse driver) that likes to store
;	private information immediately after the screen buffer for whatever
;	mode it's in. Why the f*** it does this is anyone's guess (keeps it
;	out of conventional RAM, I guess), but it screws up the cursor
