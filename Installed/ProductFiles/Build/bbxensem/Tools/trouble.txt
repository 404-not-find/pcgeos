Please take a moment to read these installation instructions. 
They will give you important information about the different 
installation options, as well as tips and tricks if you 
encounter difficulties.

You must have DOS equivalent to version 3.0 or greater, or OS/2
version 2.0 or greater to install this product.

1.) NEW INSTALL

If you choose this option, the Geoworks Ensemble 2.01 files 
will be installed into a directory named GEOS20.

If you already own Ensemble 2.0 and wish to upgrade to 
Ensemble 2.01, or if you ever need to re-install 2.01, 
choose this option.  If you can't decide which option 
is right for you, this is the safest choice.


2.) UPGRADE FROM GEOPUBLISH

Choose this option if you own GeoPublish. 
At the end of the installation, you will have a new 
directory, GEOS20, on your hard drive. The contents of 
your DOCUMENT and FONT directories from GeoPublish 
will be moved to the appropriate locations in this new 
directory. The GEOPUBL directory will be completely 
deleted during the installation, so if there are other 
files in this directory which you want to keep, make 
sure to save them before installing Ensemble 2.01.


3.) UPGRADE FROM A 1.X VERSION GEOWORKS PRODUCT

Choose this option only if you own an older version 
of Geoworks Ensemble 1.X or Pro and only if you wish 
to upgrade it to Geoworks Ensemble 2.01.

You will be asked for the location of your existing 
Geoworks directory.  The DOCUMENT and FONT directories 
in your old version will be copied into a new directory 
called GEOSBACK. The entire directory structure of your 
old version will then be deleted, so if there are other 
files which you want to keep, make sure to save copies 
of them before installing Ensemble 2.01.

Your documents, fonts, geocomm scripts and backgrounds 
will be copied from GEOSBACK to a new  directory, GEOS20, 
and automatically upgraded to the Ensemble 2.01 file format. 


4.) INSTALLATION TOOLS:

If you choose Installation Tools, you will be able to install any
of the individual files which make up Ensemble 2.01. This choice
should be used if any of the files are damaged during use after
the original installation process.


5.) FINISHED:

If you choose Finished, you will exit the installation program.

       I N S T A L L A T I O N   T I P S  &  T R I C K S:
     ******************************************************



1.)     It's always a good idea to back up any important files
        on your system. This would be an excellent time to remove
        any files that you no longer use.  Also, you should
        run a diagnostic program such as CHKDSK or SCANDISK to
        make sure your hard drive is in good working order.  To
        run CHKDSK on your C: drive, type

        CHKDSK

        at a C:\ prompt.  For more information on CHKDSK, consult
        your DOS manual.

2.)     The installation will not proceed normally if you do not
        have enough free disk space on your hard drive. You will
        need at least 10 Megabytes of free disk space to install
        Ensemble 2.01.  If the installation fails, check to see
        how much space you have left on your hard drive by typing

        DIR

        at a C:\ prompt.  At the end of the list of files you will
        see the number of bytes free on the hard drive.  If you
        have 0 bytes free, you ran out of space.  You should delete
        as many files as you can and try the install procedure again.

3.)     You may get the error "Not enough memory to install" or the
        install procedure may fail before it can copy any files
        to your hard drive if you have less than 500K (512,000 bytes)
        of free conventional memory.  The first thing to try is our
        secondary install program INSTALLB.  INSTALLB.EXE requires
        much less conventional memory than INSTALL.EXE but it will
        also take longer.

4.)     The install program will check your CONFIG.SYS for the proper
        FILES and BUFFERS size.  These should both be set to 30.
        (Unless you are using DR DOS or Novell DOS, in which case
        your FILES setting should equal 120.) If the install modifies
        your CONFIG.SYS you will need to reboot your computer for the
        changes to take effect.

5.)     The install program will check your AUTOEXEC.BAT to
        determine if the GEOS20 directory needs to be placed
        in the path.  If the install modifies your AUTOEXEC.BAT
        you will need to reboot your computer for the changes to
        take effect.

6.)     If you are having trouble with a particular floppy disk,
        you should use CHKDSK to check the integrity of the disk.
        Put the disk in the appropriate drive and type

        CHKDSK

        at the a: or b: prompt. If you get a message such as
        "Errors found" you will need replacement disks. Call our
        customer service department at 510-814-5718 for replacements.

7.)   With some computers, you may need to put disks in ALL
      available drives in order to proceed.  Additionally, it has
      been reported that when installing to a Bernoulli drive, the
      drive must be "locked" (the door shut and a cartridge placed
      in the drive) BEFORE allowing the installer to check
      available drives.  If you have a Bernoulli drive, it should
      be "locked" even if you are not attempting to install to it.

8.)   If you do not complete the installation, a residual
      directory may exist.  The DIRECTORY name will be
      ISFYQVO.TWJ and may contain a FILE called SWAPFILE.HDR.

      To delete the FILE, type the following at the DOS prompt:

                del isfyqvo.twj\*.*
                (hit the enter key)

      You will then see the following:

                All files in directory will be deleted!
                Are you sure (Y/N)?
                (hit a "y" and the enter key)

      To delete the DIRECTORY, type the following at the
      DOS prompt:

                rd isfyqvo.twj
                (hit the enter key)

9.)     You can install Ensemble 2.01 under OS/2 in a regular DOS 
        full screen box, not one that boots a specific version of 
        DOS. Therefore, the DOS_STARTUP_DRIVE setting on the session 
        page should be blank. Increase the number of DOS_FILES 
        available to that DOS box to at least 80. Make sure that the 
        HW_TIMER setting is on. All other values can be left at the 
        default.

        If you are installing from an OS/2 DOS session you may 
      receive an error message indicating that you don't have 
      enough room on your hard drive.  NOTE:  The install 
      program will allow you continue if you are sure that there 
      is enough space.

      You may also get a "SYS Error 0005. Access Denied" error 
      while installing under OS/2, because OS/2 thinks there is 
      an extended attribute set for all of the files on the 
      installation disks.
                                                                                
      To change this extended attribute:
                                                                                
      1. Use the DISKCOPY command to copy each Ensemble 2.01
      installation disk to a diskette that is not write protected.
                                                                                
      2. Run CHKDSK /f on each diskette. OS/2 will correct what 
      it thinks is an extended attribute error on every single file.

The following information may help you if you complete the installation
of Ensemble 2.01 but are having trouble getting up and running.


1.)     If you chose to use the default directory during installation,
        you will find Ensemble 2.01 in a directory called GEOS20. The 
        command to start the program is GEOS20.  Therefore, to start 
        Ensemble 2.01 from a C:\ prompt type

        CD\GEOS20
        GEOS20

        If you would like Ensemble 2.01 to start automatically when you 
        turn on the computer, type

        C:
        CD\GEOS20
        BT2GEOS

        (If you have installed Ensemble 2.01 in a directory other than 
        C:\GEOS20, substitute the appropriate drive and directory in 
        these commands.) 

        The commands above run a batch file that will modify your 
        AUTOEXEC.BAT to run Ensemble 2.01 when you turn on your computer.
        We cannot guarantee that this will work on all systems, in which
        case you will have to modify the AUTOEXEC.BAT yourself.  The 
        AUTOEXEC.BAT can be found in the root directory of the C: drive. 
        You can edit these files with any text editor such as MS-DOS' 
        Edit, DR-DOS' Editor or the Text File Editor in Ensemble 2.01.

2.)     When you install the software, a file called GEOHELP.EXE is 
        installed along with the other Geoworks files. GeoHelp is a 
        program designed to help you diagnose and fix problems you 
        may encounter. To start the GeoHelp program

        1. Install as much of Ensemble 2.01 as you can.

        2. At the DOS prompt type:

        C:
        CD \GEOS20
        GEOHELP

        (If you have installed Ensemble 2.01 in a directory other 
        than C:\GEOS20, substitute the appropriate drive and 
        directory in these commands.) 

3.)     Some hardware and software products need special treatment to 
        work with Ensemble 2.01. One way to see if a software conflict 
        is behind your problem is to boot clean. Try the following 
        procedure (which is also automated in GeoHelp). It's an easy 
        way to create a special startup disk that you can use to make 
        sure no other software programs load into memory. The beauty 
        of this method is that it makes no changes to your hard disk. 
        Note: This procedure will not work if you are using a disk 
        compression program.
        
        1.    Put a blank disk in drive A: and format it as a 
                DOS system disk by typing

                FORMAT A: /S

                at the DOS prompt.

        2.    After the format is complete, restart your machine 
                with this newly formatted disk in drive A. Your 
                computer ignores the commands in your normal 
                CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files altogether.
        3.    Run GEOS by typing

                C:
                CD\GEOS20
                GEOS20

        If Ensemble 2.01 now runs correctly, something in the CONFIG.SYS
        or AUTOEXEC.BAT file on your hard disk was probably causing the 
        problem. You need to do some trial-and-error testing adding and 
        removing lines to and from these files to isolate the problem. 

4.)     If you have extended or expanded memory (any RAM beyond 640K) 
        and you're having problems running your software, try starting 
        GEOS by typing

        GEOS20 /nomem

        At the DOS prompt in the directory where you installed 
        Ensemble 2.01. Note: You must type nomem in lowercase letters.
        The nomem parameter instructs Ensemble 2.01 to ignore any 
        extended or expanded memory in your system. If using nomem 
        solves your problem, it was probably caused by a 
        Terminate-and-Stay-Resident program (TSR) that uses your 
        expanded or extended memory. The major culprits include RAM 
        disks, disk caches, and advanced memory managers.

        If you would like to just leave things the way they are, you 
        can make the "nomem" setting permanent. Realize that if you 
        do this, Ensemble 2.01 won't use the expanded or extended memory 
        in your computer and will therefore, run slower.
        To make the nomem setting permanent

        1.      Open the Preferences desk tool.

        2.      Choose Computer.

        3.      Select None for Extra Memory Type and click OK.

        Setting the nomem parameter will not affect your other programs 
        or their use of higher memory.

5.)     To test for possible hardware conflicts, try starting GEOS 
        by typing

        GEOS20 /log 
        
        At the DOS prompt in the directory where you installed 
        Ensemble 2.01. Note: You must type log in lowercase letters. 
        The log parameter instructs GEOS to initialize all the system 
        hardware before starting. If your computer freezes, reboot and 
        check the file geos.log by typing:

        TYPE C:\GEOS20\PRIVDATA\GEOS.LOG

        This file will contain a list indicating which of the many 
        hardware devices on your system were successfully initialized. 
        The last entry will give you a better indication of where the 
        problem lies. For example, if the last thing you see on the 
        list is

        Initializing Mouse Driver

        GEOS could be having trouble with your mouse. Write down the 
        last module to be initialized before you call for technical 
        support.  If the last thing you see on the list is

        Initializing Non-Switching Task Driver

        Then GEOS probably initialized all the hardware successfully.
        While this does not rule out the possibility of a hardware 
        conflict it is a good indication that the problem lies elsewhere.
        
6.)     Ensemble 2.01 is compatible with DR DOS 6.0.  
        However, you will need the line

        FILES=120

        in your CONFIG.SYS file.

        If you are using Superstor disk compression and you get the 
        error, "Insert disk in drive C:" you have the very first 
        release of DR DOS 6.0 and Superstor and you should contact 
        Novell to receive an update. The update you will need is the 
        4/92 version or DR DOS 6.0.  There is a later 3/93 update but 
        it does not include the Superstor driver. A potential work 
        around to the problem is to put the line

        drive d = 65535

        in the GEOS.INI file in the [system] section.  This is not a 
        guaranteed solution, and if it fails, you should contact Novell 
        for an update at 1-800-NETWARE.
7.)     Ensemble 2.01 is compatible with Novell DOS 7.  However, 
        you will need the line

        FILES=120

        in your CONFIG.SYS file.

        If you are using NWCACHE, you may find it necessary to disable
        the "write delay" feature in order to run Ensemble 2.01 properly.
        Consult your DOS manual for more information about NWCACHE.

8.)     Ensemble 2.01 is compatible with Novell Netware, however, you
        must have Ensemble installed on a local hard drive.  Ensemble 2.01
        cannot be run from the network server and we do not sell network
        site licenses. Ensemble should be able to read from network drives
        and print to a network printer.  
        
        If you are connected to a Novell network, you must create a
        SHELL.CFG file in your C: drive's root directory.  To create
        the file, type

        ECHO FILE HANDLES = 100 > SHELL.CFG

        at the C:\ prompt and press enter.

9.)     There is a known conflict with QEMM's "Stealth Mode" and
        Ensemble when Ensemble is using Expanded memory.  
        One solution is to disable the stealth mode option.  
        The QEMM line in the CONFIG.SYS will look like

        DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS RAM X=C800-CBFF ST:M R:2

        Simply remove the ST:M from the line and the problem 
        should go away.
        If you want to use stealth mode for your other programs and
        tell GEOS to ignore stealth, follow this procedure:

        From the C:\GEOS20 prompt, type 

        GEOS20 /nomem 
        
        (that's a forward slash, and the nomem must be in lower case) 
        to enter Ensemble.  The /nomem tells Ensemble to ignore the 
        high memory area, which is where QEMM is causing conflicts.  

        Go into Preferences and click on the Computer button.  Under 
        Extra Memory Type, turn OFF Expanded (LIM EMS).  You can 
        turn on Extended and XMS/HIMEM.SYS, if they aren't already
        selected.  Click on the OK button.  When Ensemble tells you 
        it needs to be restarted, click on OK, then Yes.  The next 
        time you want to enter Ensemble, you can just type GEOS20 at 
        the C:\GEOS20 prompt.

10.)    If you get a "SHARE.EXE Table Overflow Error" when trying
        to run Ensemble 2.01, try adding

        INSTALL=C:\DOS\SHARE.EXE /f:4096

        to your CONFIG.SYS file.  If the error message persists,
        increase the number 4096 in increments of 2048 until the
        problem goes away.  It should not be necessary to use a
        number higher than 10240.

11.)    If you get the error "GEOS.INI file has been corrupted"
        when you try to run Ensemble 2.01, you will need to restore
        the file. The GEOS.INI file is located in the C:\GEOS20
        directory and contains information about your preferences 
        settings. Should the file ever become damaged, you can copy 
        the original GEOS.INI file from installation disk #1 by typing

        COPY A:GEOS.INI C:\GEOS20

        (If you have installed Ensemble 2.01 in a directory other 
        than C:\GEOS20, or your installation disk is in a different
        drive, substitute the appropriate drive and directory in these
        commands.)  
        You will then have to reconfigure your preferences settings 
        such as your mouse and printer driver selections.  You may
        wish to make a backup of your GEOS.INI file to avoid having to
        reconfigure your preferences in case of this particular
        problem.

12.)    If you have difficulty reading any of your drives or 
        if any phantom drives show up that do not belong, you should 
        try editing the GEOS.INI file to tell GEOS the exact drive 
        specifications.  For example in the [system] section of the 
        GEOS.INI file you could add the line

        drive b = 0

        This tells GEOS to ignore drive b.  Using the format 

        drive <letter> = <number> 

        you can use any of the following drive specifications

        0       =>      Ignore the drive
        360     =>      360K Low Density 5.25" floppy disk
        720     =>      720K Low Density 3.5" floppy disk
        1200    =>      1.2M High Density 5.25" floppy disk
        1440    =>      1.44M High Density 3.5" floppy disk
        2880    =>      2.88M 3.5" floppy disk
        65535   =>      Hard drive

        If trouble reading, copying or formatting floppies persists, try putting

        waitpost = false

        in the [system] section of the GEOS.INI file.

13.)    If you completed the install and you cannot see anything on 
        your screen when you try to start Ensemble 2.01, the install 
        program may have chosen the wrong video driver.  The first 
        step in solving this problem is to know what type of video 
        adapter you have.  If you do not know, you should contact your 
        hardware vendor to find out.  Then follow these steps
        
        A.    Run install from the first disk again by typing a:install
        
        B.    Choose the Installation Tools Option
        
        C.    Install one of the following files based on your

                REN LOADERHG.EXE LOADER.EXE

        In this example we installed loaderhg.exe into the geos20 
        directory.  If you have a different display device or you 
        installed Ensemble 2.01 in a different directory, 
        substitute the appropriate display device and directory 
        in the commands above.

        E.    Edit the GEOS.INI file to add the appropriate video 
        driver entries immediately below the line [screen 0]

                device = VGA: 640x480 16-Color
                driver = Standard VGA Driver
                
                device = EGA: 640x350 16-Color
                driver = EGA Driver

                device = CGA Compatible: 640x200 Mono
                driver = CGA Driver

                device = IBM MCGA: 640x480 Mono
                driver = MCGA Driver

                device = Hercules HGC Compatible: 720x348 Mono
                driver = Hercules Monochrome Driver

        A few systems have to be switched to graphics mode from 
        the keyboard before they will run Ensemble 2.01. If you 
        start Ensemble 2.01 and get a blank screen, try typing 
        either of these commands at the DOS prompt before you 
        start Ensemble 2.01:

        MODE CO80 (that's c o 8 zero - changes to 80-column mode on some systems) 

                or

        MODE MONO (changes to monochrome mode on some systems)

        WARNING: Make sure that you have backup copies of any files that
        are important to you. Improper use of the uninstall program will 
        result in data loss. 

        We have included a program called UNINSTAL.BAT that will 
        completely remove Ensemble 2.01 from your hard drive. This 
        program will remove any documents you have created along with 
        the system files, therefore we recommend that you use extra caution. 
        To completely remove Ensemble 2.01, type:

        CD\GEOS20
        UNINSTAL

        at a C:\ prompt. (If you have installed Ensemble 2.01 in a 
        directory other than C:\GEOS20, substitute the appropriate 
        drive and directory in these commands.)
