* Make the RCP a tool bar. Fine tune its behavior.
  ???

* Allow the Field Organizer to be closed.
  Estimated time: 1/2 - 1 day

* Make the Design/Data-entry switch via a menu item; same with single-record
  vs. multi-record (not worth the precious screen real-estate).
  Estimated time: 1 day

* Add grids, guides, and rulers.
  Estimated time: 5 days (for C definitions & implementation)

* Make the multi-record design mode have outlines for objects within
  the single records.
  Estimated time: 1-2 weeks (?)

* Make the single record size be based on rulers.
  Estimated time: 1 week.

* Have an option to make computed fields recalculate whenever
  displayed, and another option to compute specified computed fields
  through all records.
  Estimated time: 1 week.

* Delete Marked fields.
  Estimated time: 2 days.

* Add a Picture field type.
  An idea: have the VM handle stored as a floating point number.  This
  is great for a number of reasons: computed pictures, no extra work
  in implementation.  Also: keep track of pictures in a table w/ref
  counts, so no duplication of graphics.
  Estimated time: 3 weeks.

* Add an Enumerated Type field type.
  This would be nice, but would probably take a lot of time.
  Estimated time: 4 weeks.

* Add radio buttons/check boxes
  Estimated time: no idea.

* Allow importing into an existing database.
  Estimated time: 3 weeks.

* Allow copying records.
  Estimated time: 1 week.

* Have a floating expression builder in data entry mode that can
  evaluate expressions on the fly.
  Estimated time: 1 week.
