* Matt wanted to talk about referring to "record layout," "page
  layout," and "show-me-the-totals-and-subtotals layout" as "records
  layout," "multi-record layout," and "report layout" instead.

* How do we define subtotal order?  How do we make it clear that this
  changes (or resets? or not?) the sorting order of the current
  layout?

* Great idea: have the format of a field appear in the
  lower-right-hand corner of its rectangle in design mode.  For
  example, if the field is in decimal format with three places of
  accuracy, have "123.456" appear.  If the thing is an integer,
  display "123", etc.

* Another great idea: have a free-floating expression-builder dialogue
  box available in data entry mode that could be filled in with any
  database-wide expression, and that would evaluate into a text field
  in the dialogue box.  You could do mighty cooool things, esp. if you
  need a quick answer based on the current field (heck, it even makes
  for a hard to use but very powerful calculator!).

* I'd like there to be an easily accessible way (perhaps in the RCP) that
  would display a condensed summary of the selected field(s) field
  properties (i.e. their design) while in Data Entry mode.  Even with well
  chosen field labels it would be a great thing for my feeble brain to be
  able to find out the exact definition of any given field without having
  to switch modes (and thus forget what I was looking for :-).

* How to handle the auto-field-layout?  (This comes from a discussion about
  the way the demo/hacked auto-field-layout just increments some offset
  value to determine where to put the field (this means that moving a field
  from the active to the inactive and back again will result in the field
  being in a different place).)

* Easy one: have a "re-evaluate default expression" for the current field.
  An alternative could be an option for re-evaluating the default if a field
  gets the focus and is currently blank.

* Debug Mode

* Opening up application: Will it be like Apple Geos, w/ a dialog box of
  choice Open/Create New? What will other apps do?

* How do we deal with labels?  Is it a print option?  What's the UI?
