questions:

(-) deal with incoming attachments (save, open, convert)

(-) IACP for mailto: tags in browser

(-) IACP for http:// links in <x-html>?

(2) re-enable/disable "Sign" when signature edited?

(4) change read and compose text objects to VisLargeTextClass objects
to handle >32K

(6) something that NewMail and the libraries don't support but should
is mapping the text to the Latin-1 character set (Windows) as needed
and adding:

Content-type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1

(8) change Account name to be cached (FileLongName? use list text?)

(12) change edited message moniker to "New Message: [subject] when editing
messages in the Outbox (be sure to reset for new messages)

(13) change date displayed in Read Message Window to full day, full month

(14) need to rescan if throw away message (also from compose window) while
current folder is Trash

(15) It does not seem that tony supplied monikers for both @readMoniker and 
@editMoniker.  For now replaced them both with @readMessageToolMoniker.  When 
this is finalized need to delete @readMoniker and @editMoniker from
uiStrings.goc and global.goh
