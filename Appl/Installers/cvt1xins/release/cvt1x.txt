This utility package will allow you to update old Geoworks Ensemble version 1.x documents to the newer Geos format so that your Breadbox Ensemble applications can read them.

To use this converter you MUST be using the Motif look and feel.  in Geomanager, select the document(s) you want to convert then click the Utilities menu item and the Upgrade 1.X Document sub-menu item.  The selected document(s) will be converted to the newer Geos format.

NOTE:  This conversion process is NOT reversable.  Once a document is converted you will not be able to read it in Geoworks Ensemble 1.x versions.
