DESCRIPTION:

		This makes sure that the resources will be layed out in
	aspecific order in the geode that match the expected ordering
	of the launcher creation code in GeoManager.

				***Warning***

		This scheme doesn't work anymore, as the 'nosort' key in
	the .gp file allows the resource layout to be set in the .gp file.
	I'm leaving this the way it is because it is, if nothing else,
	documentation.

		Make sure this ordering matches the .gp file's ordering, and
	that they both match the GeoManager ordering for what resources go
	where.
