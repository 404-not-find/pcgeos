Spider Solitaire -= beta 2 =-

Changes from beta 1:
- Added two more difficulty levels.  At these two levels you can move single cards from one working deck to another as long as the exposed card on the receiving deck is one higher in rank than the moving card - suits do not matter.  BUT - you cannot move multiple cards at once unless thay are all of the same suit and in rank order.  As in the easiest level, a King thru Ace run is removed automatically from the working deck.  I can win fairly regluarly (3 of 4 times) at level 1.  Level 2 is much more difficult, I can win only maybe one of 5 or 6 games.  I have yet to win level 3.

Spider Solitaire -= beta 1 =-

Up Front Notice - Your Geos must be running at 800x600 or higher to play this game!

This Geos version is similar to the one that comes with Windows XP.  The biggest difference is that this one has only the easy playing level.  The others will follow...

The game is played with 2 modified decks of cards - there are the regulation 104 cards but thery are all spades.  So there are eight Aces of spades, twos of spades, etc.

The object is to build runs from King down thru Ace on the ten working decks at the top of the board.  As soon as the game detects a K thru A run it removes that run from the board and places it (King up) at the lower left corner of the board.  You win the game when you have made all eight K thru A runs.

You can move a card (left mouse button drag) from one working deck to another as long as the deck it is being moved to ends with the card next higher in rank from the card you are moving.  You can move multiple cards at once as long as all the cards that you are moving off the top of the work deck are in sequence.  As soon as you have moved all the face up cards off a working deck the game automatically turns the top card of that deck (if any) face up.  Once all cards have been removed from any of the working decks you may place any card (or sequence of cards) in that spot.

When you cannot make any moves among the cards on the 10 working decks, left click the deck at the lower right corner of the board.  This will deal the next 10 cards out, face up, one each to the 10 work decks.  There is one gotcha here - you cannot deal from the deck at the lower right if there are any open slots in the 10 working decks.  There must be at least one card in every slot to deal.

You can undo a move by selecting Undo from the Game menu.  Note that the undo goes back only one move - no multiple undos.  That would be too much like cheating, right?

*******************************************************
Known bugs & feature requests:


*******************************************************
Fixed bugs:
- Every so often a run of cards that is not King thru Ace will react as if it 
  is a complete run and take itself to the done stacks at the lower left.  If 
  you can pinpoint the circumstances of that case please let me know.  It's 
  driving me crazy!  3/16/03 - Fixed by making sure that the checks for the 13 
  card run test only FACE UP cards!!!
- One was when a stack came down to the left bottom corner and I tried an Undo
  (you might not believe this, but I spotted a better option after I'd
  completed a stack). Program not happy, KR-09'ed Ensemble. Maybe not many
  people will try this, but it's one way to halt your card game good and
  proper. Fixed 4/14/03
- you cannot deal from the deck at the lower right if there are any open slots 
  in the 10 working decks.  There must be at least one card in every slot to deal."
  Looks like I need to add a dialog box notifying players of this Fixed 4/14/03
- Smarter notification boxes (eg new game at end of game (no more deal decks)) 
  fixed 4/15/03
- Smarter notification boxes (eg changing difficulty - 86 extra warning at begin) 
  fixed 4/15/03
- Undoing after a move that automagically flips the new top card of a stack should 
  probably turn that card back over.  fixed 4/15/03
- check screen res  fixed 4/15/03
- minor cleanup after move to done?  fixed 4/16/03
- Smarter notification boxes (eg winner notification based on diff level)  
  fixed 4/16/03
- - If you get a very large stack on the rightmost working deck it can cover up the 
  deal deck, then you're stuck.  I need to have the vertical distance between face 
  up cards automagically reduce itself in this case.
  - You can also lose access to the exposed card of a very large stack on a work 
  deck if it goes below the screen boundaries.  Same fix as above.
  - resizing playing field?
  I can't get an entire work deck to adjust to a new respread - only the newly 
  dragged cards take the new spread :-(  So the fix was to move the done and deal 
  decks in toward the center by 10 pixels and keep the screen resizable  4/18/03
- table color like FreeCell  fixed 4/18/03
- sounds added 4/22/03
- can't tell suit of Ace at highest difficulty level fixed 4/23/03
