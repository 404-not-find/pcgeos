03/23/99 (Lysle):
  - Added expiration dialog for April 15, 1999.

  - Modified About box to show ALPHA 1 verison.

  - File opening problem with download is now fixed (Make8Dot3 was
    incorrectly programmed).

  - Modifed the FTPLIB to use bigger blocks of data to upload and download
    data to keep the system running at full speed.

  - Rereading of the remote directory occurs correctly after all commands.

  - Password is hidden in the log.

  - Added the 'Parent Directory' or CDUP command for sites that don't
    put the ".." specifier on their FTP pages.

  - Activated Rename command.  Finally correctly used RNFR and RNTO in
    FTPLIB.

  - Removed the stop command from the menu and instead made a Cancel button
    in the progress dialog.

  - Got the progress dialog working correctly and showing the percentage
    of files transferred along with the status text repeated there.

  - Made change directory dialog modal along with all other major command
    dialogs.

  - Got rid of 'Get manual' command since its not a standard and is
    confusing.

  - Current directory on remote server is now fed into Change remove dir
    dialog (so user can modify from there).

  - Activated Delete command only to find no DELETE support in FTPLIB.
    Added DELETE support to FTPLIB.

  - Make directory support added.

03/16/99 (Lysle):

  - Made the configuration infomration in the connect dialog save out.

  - All commands that would send a NULL as its parameter list no longer
    crash.  This is CDUP and QUIT especially.  ECCheckBounds does not
    work on NULL.

  - Fixed a crash with destroying the second ftp thread.  It now correctly
    waits for the thread to detach before freeing its related memory.
