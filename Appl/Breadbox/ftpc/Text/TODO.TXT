Breadbox FTP To Do List:

* Select all files when enter subdir (or just take all)

* create sub dir on ftp site when uploading

* Make encrypted in .INI file

* Better dialog error messages (for rarer cases).  For now, if it just
  depends on messages in the log.

* Make everything work in batch mode.  This includes making the progress
  window more appropriate for batch processing (file # out of # etc.)

* FTP_PROCESS_LIST_CREATE had a run off the end in strlen.  But this is because
  the p variable ended up somewhere past the end of the buffer of memory
  and off into some code elsewhere.  Very bad.  Especially since there was
  a *p = '\0' command previously.



Other notes:

- Working directory is stored in the FTP object -- not so much as forced.
  However, once you get it the first time, isn't it going to be the same?
