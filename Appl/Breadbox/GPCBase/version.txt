 - fixed tiny icons not showing up
 - version 0.6.0.1 to GPC
Known bugs as of 2/19/99...
 - Help, resize, and max buttons do not appear on report window title bar.  Appears to be because I've supressed the sys menu (I want to do some closing stuff).  This problem only appeared when help context ATTR was moved from reply bar to title bar.  Prior to moving the help to the title bar, the resize and max buttons were there.

 - Can't get the tiny (15 x 15) icon to show up on the title bar.
 - Copy button in Report Window doesn't grey when nothing is selected.  This is because the Edit controller was changed in build 5 (the require and prohibit UI features) so I bypassed the edit menu completely for the Copy and Select All big buttons.
 - No Copy item in the main edit window.  Also Select All and Undo are not prohibited.  Likely due to above Edit controller change.
