--------

990529:

  - Files on MMC and in subfolders of "Own texts" can now be accessed as well.

990517:

  - Added Zoom key support for 9110.

  - Replaced SymbolPS dummy font by Clemens' latest (smaller) update.

990515:

  - Fixed bug that would lead to incomplete display on some large Notes files.

  - Added hint to reduce margins in view window on 9110, giving more space
    for the actual text (similar to Notes view).

  - Only "Own Texts" and "Downloaded Files" folders are now shown in the
    NView application. All other directories are pointless anyway because
    they won't typically contain any file types we can handle.

  - Added Falk's icons.

  - Spell-checked help file.

  - Line breaks are now removed from the document because they confuse the
    standard Notes viewer (causing some of the text to disappear, typically
    after import from RTF).

  - Added SymbolPS dummy font with bullets in place.

990508:

  - Changed file selector to FileOpenControl, which gives a more Notes-like
    UI, with proper supression of unwanted folders.

  - Integrated David's fix for RTF library.

  - PalmDoc file types are checked to properly reject unknown .PDB/.PRC
    files.

  - Disabled "Save Note/Save RTF" triggers if file already was in that format.

  - Showing name of currently viewed file in title.

  - Added Zoom function.

  - Removed old style plug-in support (calling application with a file name).

  - Moved some strings into localizable resources.

  - Added error checking for saving files (RTF).

  - Added plain text error messages.

  - Converted to viewer library.

  - Added heapspace value (internal).

  - Temporary files are now created with a unique name.

  - Added progress dialog while file is loaded/saved.

  - Added help file.
