   - the strings must be in alphabetical order by type, with income first,
	then expense
   - sub-categories must be in alphabetical order within their parent
   - the fields are separated by an asterisk (*)
   - field 1 - type (either I for income or E for expense)
   - field 2 - category name (19 character maximum)
   - field 3 - parent cat (if any)
   - field 4 - number of sub-categories
   - there can be up to 100 entries
   - the routine that reads in the defaults will stop when it encounters a
