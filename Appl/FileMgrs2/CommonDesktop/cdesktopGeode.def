; COMPILATION CONSTANTS:  Our goal is to make file managers
; "feature-based", rather than "product-based".  We're a long way off
; from this goal, as there's a great deal of code that's product-based,
; but please do your part to help by using generalizable features
; whenever possible.  Also, if you add a feature, please add a
; description of that feature here, so that future engineers will know
; whether to turn that feature on or off when building new file
; managers.

_WINDOW_MENU 		= TRUE
; Determines whether the app has a window menu or not.  If not, then

; full-screen.


_PEN_BASED 		= FALSE
; This flag is used to allow quick-transfers using the
; MSG_META_(START/DRAG/END)_SELECT mechanism, rather than MOVE_COPY,
; which is unavailable on such systems.


_CONNECT_TO_REMOTE 	= FALSE
; This flag enables connection capabilities.  The default interface
; presumed by CONNECT_TO_REMOTE is a trigger in the disk menu.
; Setting CONNECT_MENU (below) will override this, creating a
; separate "Connect" menu.  CONNECT_ICON (below) determines if an
; icon will appear.  For these things to appear, the DF_CONNECT flag 
; must also be set in the .INI file (under fileManager:features).  

_CONNECT_ICON		= FALSE

; true to use this flag.

_CONNECT_MENU 		= FALSE
; This flag enables a separate "Connect" menu which has File Linking
; and File Transfer options.  If CONNECT_TO_REMOTE is true and 
; CONNECT_MENU is FALSE, the connect trigger will appear in the
; disk menu.  CONNECT_MENU is used in ZManager.  CONNECT_TO_REMOTE
; must be true to set this flag.

; linking is established.  This is to prevent switching to other apps
; that may be behind GeoManager.  Not necessary in HManager, because
; that app is always maximized, and has no express menu.

; which there is no local copy.  Fixes problem where local standard paths
