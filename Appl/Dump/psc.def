; Structure placed on the stack by things wanting to use PSCPutChar. PB_ptr is
; the offset into PB_data at which the next character is to be put. PB_file is
; the handle of the file being written. When the buffer is full, it will be
; written to disk. The PSCBuffer is assumed to be the first local variable
; declared for the calling function so PSCPutChar and PSCFlush can simply
; inherit their stack frame.
