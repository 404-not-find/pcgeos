General Procedure:
==================
For all major parts of the system there are .ui/.uih/.asm/.def files.
It is especially important to keep the .uih consistent with the .def
files.

Major Building Blocks
=====================

bigcalMain:
-----------
./bigcalc.gp
./bigcalcMain.def
./bigcalcMain.uih
./bigcalcMain.asm
./bigcalcMain.ui
./bigcalcExtraMain.ui
Contains the include stuff as well as the Primary

bigcalcCalc:
------------
./bigcalcCalc.def
./bigcalcCalc.uih
./bigcalcCalc.ui
./bigcalcCalc.asm
./bigcalcMemory.asm
Holds the calculator ui with all its keypads and buttons, plus the
Memory box.  Sends the messages to the CalcEngine

bigcalcProcess:
---------------
./bigcalcProcess.def
./bigcalcProcess.asm
Acts as a supervisor.  Is the coordinator between the Calculator, its
outer functions, and the PreCannedFunction

bigcalcMath:
------------
./bigcalcMath.uih
./bigcalcMath.ui
./bigcalcMath.def
./bigcalcMath.asm
./bigcalcUnaryCvt.asm
Contains the CalcEngine, i.e. both the Infix and the RPN intenals of
the calculator as well as unary conversion.  Does the math.

bigcalcPCF:
-----------
./bigcalcPCF.uih
./bigcalcPCF.def
./bigcalcTemplate.ui
./bigcalcPCF.ui
./bigcalcVariableArgsPCF.asm
./bigcalcPCF.asm
./bigcalcFixedArgsPCF.asm
./bigcalcBuildPCF.asm
./bigcalcBuildVariableArgsPCF.asm
./bigcalcBuildFixedArgsPCF.asm
./bigcalcData.ui
./bigcalcHolder.asm
All functionality relating to PreCannedFunction's.  That include
buidling from the Template with Data, Build-ing it, Hold-ing it and
then computing with it.

bigcalcFiniteState:
-------------------
./bigcalcFiniteState.asm
Ensures that only legal fp numbers are entered.

Useless files:
--------------
./bigcalcDCtrl.asm
./bigcalcApplication.asm

Caveats
=======
* Due to the nature of the fp and the ssheet lib it is impaerative
that all numbers that are being passed on are legal fp numbers.  This
is easily ensures by a) getting numbers that were produced by the fp
library or b) passing user input through the FSM.  The mechnism can be
found by looking at the way the CalcInoutField parses input.

* It is important that the MSG's in bigcalcProcess.def are in the same
order as the ones in bigcalcMath.def.  If a MSG is added in one place,
it has to be added in the same place in the corresponding file.

* In order to add a new PCF, look at bigcalcData.ui for all the data
that is neccessary.  Then add the item to the selector lists.  There
are a few "CheckHack"s in the code, so the compiler should alert you
if you forget to add some info to some table.
