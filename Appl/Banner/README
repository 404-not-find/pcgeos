This is a breakdown of the files used by banner.
For a more technical description of how some features are implemented read
the beginning of banner.asm.


banner.ui		This contains the ui, all the text messages, and
			the help text.  It is also were the artwork is
			included.

bannerUI.asm		This is where all routines are kept which are used
			by the ui.  Examples of this are changing the text,
			fonts, or special effects.  This does not contain
			the routines to handle the drawing or printing of
			the banner.

bannerDraw.asm		Everything needed to draw the banner is in here.
			This includes the routines for all the special
			effects.

bannerPrint.asm		To print a banner, there are routines here which
			are called.  These perform the calculations for
			printing and then it calls bannerDraw for each
			section which needs printing.  Another example
			of what is handled here is the setting the
			document name when printing.

banner.asm		This includes the above files.  Besides that it
			has most constants, a few structures, and routines
			which don't fit into any of the above files like
			BannerOpenApplication and BannerHelp and also
			some common routines like BannerGetTextString.
