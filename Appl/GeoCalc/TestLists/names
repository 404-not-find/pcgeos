		testlist for names
=============================================================================

Things to test:
---------------
		Basic Name Operations
		---------------------
*1) Create a cell that references a name which has not been defined.
	==> In A1 enter "=foo"
	*** The cell should display #NAME# indicating that there
	    is a reference to a name that does not exist.

*2) Define the name referenced in the cell (foo). Give it the definition '1'.
	==> Formula->Define Name, New, Name = foo, Definition = 1
	*** The cell should recalculate and display the new value (1)

*3) Define a new name (refNameOne) and define it as referring to another
   name (refNameTwo).
	==> Formula->Define Name, New, Name = refNameOne, Definition = refNameTwo
   
   Define the other name (refNameTwo) and define it as referring to the
   first name (refNameOne)
	==> Formula->Define Name, New, Name = refNameTwo, Definition = refNameOne
   
   Create a cell that references the first name
	==> In A2 enter "=refNameOne"
	*** The cell should display "#CNAME#" indicating that a circular
	    name reference was encountered.

   Create a cell that references the second name
	==> In A3 enter "=refNameTwo"
	*** The cell should display "#CNAME#" indicating that a circular
	    name reference was encountered.

*4) Define a new name (newName) and define it as '1'.
	==> Formula->Define Name, New, Name = newName, Definition = 1
   
   Create a cell that references the name
   	==> In A4 enter "=newName"

   Delete the name
   	==> Formula->Define Name, Select 'newName', Delete
	*** The cell should recalculate and display "#NAME#" indicating
	    that the cell refers to an undefined name.

*5) Define the name 'newName' again
	==> Formula->Define Name, New, Name = newName, Definition = 1
	*** The cell should recalculate and display '1'

   Change the title of the name
   	==> Formula->Define Name, Change, Name = changedName
	*** The edit bar should display the cell formula with the new name

*6) Define a name with no definition.
	==> Formula->Define Name, New, Name = noDef
	*** Should generate error dialog box and no change

*7) Define a name with no name.
	==> Formula->Define Name, New, Definition = 1
	*** Should generate error dialog box and no change

*8) Change the title of a name to be the same as a name that is
   referenced, but not defined.
	==> Formula->Define Name, New, Name = qq, Definition = 1
        ==> In A5 enter "=qq" (Will display '1.00')
	==> In A6 enter "=xx" (Will display '#NAME#')
	==> Formula->Define Name, Select 'qq' and change the name to 'xx'
	*** Both cells should show '1.00' and both should display
	    '=xx' in the edit bar.

*9) Change the definition of refNameTwo to be 1.
	==> Formula->Define Name, Change, Definition = 1
	*** Both cells A2 and A3 should display '1'



		Operations with Names in Scraps
		-------------------------------
There are several cases to test, both within a single spreadsheet and
between spreadsheets. These should be tested with Cut/Copy/Paste and also
with quick-move/copy. I suggest new files for these. It works best for me
if I tile the two files.

*1) Copy and Paste a name that is defined the same in both spreadsheets.
	Define the name in both places
	==> In File1: Formula->Define Name, New, Name = defBothSame, Def = 1
	==> In File2: Formula->Define Name, New, Name = defBothSame, Def = 1
	
	In File1 enter a cell that references the name
	==> In File1: In A1 enter "=defBothSame"
	
	Copy the cell from File1 to File2
	==> In File1: Select A1, choose Edit->Copy
	==> In File2: Click in cell A1, choose Edit->Paste
	
	*** The cell should display '1' and the edit-bar should display
	    "=defBothSame".

*2a) Copy and Paste a name that is defined different in both spreadsheets.
	Define the name in both places
	==> In File1: Formula->Define Name, New, Name = defBothDiff, Def = 1
	==> In File2: Formula->Define Name, New, Name = defBothDiff, Def = 2
	
	In File1 enter a cell that references the name
	==> In File1: In A2 enter "=defBothDiff"
	
	Copy the cell from File1 to File2
	==> In File1: Select A2, choose Edit->Copy
	==> In File2: Click in cell A2, choose Edit->Paste
	
	You will be asked which definition to use. Choose to use the
	definition in the target spreadsheet.
	
	*** The cell should display '2' and the edit-bar should display
	    "=defBothDiff".

*2b) Copy and Paste a name that is defined different in both spreadsheets.
	Define the name in both places
	==> In File1: Formula->Define Name, New, Name = defBothDiff, Def = 1
	==> In File2: Formula->Define Name, New, Name = defBothDiff, Def = 2
	
	In File1 enter a cell that references the name
	==> In File1: In A2 enter "=defBothDiff"
	
	Copy the cell from File1 to File2
	==> In File1: Select A2, choose Edit->Copy
	==> In File2: Click in cell B2, choose Edit->Paste
	
	You will be asked which definition to use. Choose to use the
	definition in the scrap.
	
	*** The cell should display '1' and the edit-bar should display
	    "=defBothDiff0".

*3a) Copy and Paste a name that is defined only in the source and which
    is not defined or referenced in the destination.
	Define the name
	==> In File1: Formula->Define Name, New, Name = defOne, Def = 1

	In File1 enter a cell that references the name
	==> In File1: In A3 enter "=defOne"
	
	Copy the cell from File1 to File2
	==> In File1: Select A3, choose Edit->Copy
	==> In File2: Click in cell A3, choose Edit->Paste

	*** The cell should display '1' and the edit-bar should display
	    "=defOne".

*3b) Copy and Paste a name that is defined only in the source and which
    is not defined but is referenced in the destination.
	Define the name
	==> In File1: Formula->Define Name, New, Name = defOneA, Def = 1

	In File1 enter a cell that references the name
	==> In File1: In B3 enter "=defOneA"
	
	In File2 enter a cell that references the name
	==> In File1: In B3 enter "=defOneA"
	
	Copy the cell from File1 to File2
	==> In File1: Select B3, choose Edit->Copy
	==> In File2: Click in cell C3, choose Edit->Paste

	*** The cell should display '1' and the edit-bar should display
	    "=defOneA". Cell B3 should also recalculate and display '1'
	    while the edit-bar should show "=defOneA".

*4) Copy and Paste a name that is undefined but referenced in the source
   and which is defined in the destination.
	Define the name
	==> In File2: Formula->Define Name, New, Name = defTwo, Def = 1

	In File1 enter a cell that references the name
	==> In File1: In A4 enter "=defTwo"
	
	Copy the cell from File1 to File2
	==> In File1: Select A4, choose Edit->Copy
	==> In File2: Click in cell A4, choose Edit->Paste

	*** The cell should display '1' and the edit-bar should display
	    "=defTwo".

*5a) Copy and Paste a name which is undefined in the source and which is
    undefined but referenced in the destination.
	Define the references
	==> In File1: In A5 enter "=undefRef"
	==> In File2: In A5 enter "=undefRef"

	Copy the cell from File1 to File2
	==> In File1: Select A5, choose Edit->Copy
	==> In File2: Click in cell B5, choose Edit->Paste

	*** The cell should display '#NAME#' and the edit-bar should display
	    "=undefRef".

*5b) Copy and Paste a name which is undefined in the source and which is
    undefined and unreferenced in the destination.
	Define the reference
	==> In File1: In A6 enter "=undefRefOne"

	Copy the cell from File1 to File2
	==> In File1: Select A6, choose Edit->Copy
	==> In File2: Click in cell A6, choose Edit->Paste

	*** The cell should display '#NAME#' and the edit-bar should display
	    "=undefRefOne".

*6) Copy and Paste all varieties of names in the same spreadsheet
	==> In File1: Select A1:A6, choose Edit->Copy
	==> In File1: Select A7,    choose Edit->Paste

	*** All references should show up the same in A7:A12 as they
	    are in A1:A6.

*7) Cut and Paste all varieties of names in the same spreadsheet
	==> In File1: Select A1:A12, choose Edit->Cut
	==> In File1: Select A1,     choose Edit->Paste

	*** The spreadsheet should look the same as when you cut.
	    What's special about this is that the undefined but
	    referenced names should have gotten nuked, and then
	    recreated when you pasted.

*8) Paste a scrap which references a name over the only references to an
   undefined name with the same title.
	Create the name
	==> In File1: Formula->Define Name, New, Name = undefName, Def = 1

	Create the references
	==> In File2: In A7 enter "=undefName"
	==> In File1: In A7 enter "=undefName" (should display '1')

	Copy the cell from File1 to File2
	==> In File1: Select A7, choose Edit->Copy
	==> In File2: Click in cell A7, choose Edit->Paste

	*** The cell should display '1' and the edit-bar should display
	    "=undefName". What's special about this is that the last
	    reference to the undefined name vanishes and then a new reference
	    is inserted.
