MegaFileFSFunction	etype	word, FSFunction, 2

DR_MFS_CLOSE_MEGAFILE			enum MegaFileFSFunction
;
;	Desc:	The caller is about to do something unavoidable that will
;		have the rather unpleasant side effect of closing our
;		megafile. (Such as calling the NetWare API to perform a login -
;		NetWare will close the file, but DOS still thinks it is
;		opened, and does not free up the JFT slot.) In such cases,
;		call this first so that we can properly close the file.
;	Pass:	nothing
;	Return:	carry set if couldn't close the file.
;

DR_MFS_REOPEN_MEGAFILE			enum MegaFileFSFunction
;
;	Desc:	The caller has done something that caused our megafile
;		to be closed (e.g. logging in as someone else on the
;		network), so we must re-open it to continue living.
;	Pass:	nothing
;	Return:	carry set if couldn't reopen the file.
