; The Bullet EMM driver recognizes all frames in high memory (8000h - a000h)
; automatically.  Any additional frames must be mapped to 7000h when the
; driver is loaded.  Currently, we have a800h - b400h mapped to 7000h.
; (That assumes that the RAM/ROM drivers, which also use b400h, are well-
; behaved, and will save and restore the mapping for b400h when they are
; initialized.)
;
; The frames a800h - b400h are numbered from 0, and high memory from 
; 4 to 12.  Thus, the bank used for swapping, b400h is number 3.
