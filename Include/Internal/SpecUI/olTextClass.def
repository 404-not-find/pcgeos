DESCRIPTION:
	Definition of OLTextClass.

	OLText is the OPEN LOOK display-only text object.

	The geometry manager attempts to fit the displayed text so
	that it is entirely displayed, when this is not possible,
	the text is placed in a view, and a scrollbar is provided
	to allow the user to scroll through the area.

	To make scrolling more pleasing to the eye, the scroll-increment
	(the amount that is scrolled when you press on the up/down
	arrows in the scrollbar) is set to the height of a single line,
	this makes the text appear to scroll one line at a time.
