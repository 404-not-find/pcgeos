DESCRIPTION:
	Definition of OLMenuedWinClass.

	This is a subclass of OLWinClass for windowed objects which
	have title bars, menus, and can be iconified.

	Note on minimize/maximize modes: all of the attribute and state
	information for these modes is kept in the OLWinClass instance
	data, so that the system menu knows which items are enabled, etc.
	ALL OF THE WORK for these modes is done at this subclass level,
	since we don't want OLWinClass to contain tons of pointers for
	GenPrimary and GenDisplay-specific things.
