DESCRIPTION:
	Definitions of functions that are "internal" to the kernel's Drive
	module. In other words, they are exported by the kernel but you'd
	better be damn sure what you're doing before trying to use them.

					;  drive's IFS driver. Only one thread
					;  at a time is allowed to try and
					;  lock a disk down.

					;  12/27/00 ayuen: This is now changed
					;  such that multiple threads can call
					;  DR_FS_DISK_LOCK at the same time,
					;  and it's up to the IFS driver to
					;  decide whether or not, or when, to
					;  enforce mutual-exclusion within its
					;  routine.   (See DiskLockCommon.)
