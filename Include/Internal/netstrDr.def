DESCRIPTION:
	Header for users of the parallel port driver. Most of the function
	and type definitions are found in strDriver.def. Only the added
	functions and types are defined here.

;
; NOTE: All stream driver functions except DR_STREAM_READ and
; DR_STREAM_READ_BYTE are valid for the parallel driver and take the same
; parameters except where noted below. Where streamDriver.def refers to a
; "stream token", you should pass the unit number (a member of the
; ParallelPortNum enumerated type)
;
;------------------------------------------------------------------------------

;DR_STREAM_OPEN		Alias for DR_STREAM_CREATE defined in strDriver.def
;	PASS:	ax	= StreamOpenFlags. SOF_NOBLOCK and SOF_TIMEOUT
;			  are mutually exclusive...
;		bx	= unit number to open
;		dx	= output buffer size
;		bp	= timeout value if SOF_TIMEOUT and not SOF_NOBLOCK
;	RETURN:	carry set if port couldn't be opened
;		 (in-use/timed-out/non-existent)

;DR_STREAM_CLOSE	Alias for DR_STREAM_DESTROY defined in strDriver.def
;	PASS:	ax 	= STREAM_LINGER if should wait for all data to
;			  make it out the port, or STREAM_DISCARD if any
;			  pending data should be discarded.
;		bx	= unit number
;	RETURN:	nothing
;

;DR_STREAM_GET_DEVICE_MAP (definition of return value)
;	PASS:	nothing
;	RETURN:	ax	= ParallelDeviceMap of available parallel ports.
;			  For each member of ParallelPortNum, the port exists
;			  if AX AND (1 SHL PARALLEL_LPT?) is true.
