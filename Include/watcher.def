;------------------------------------------------------------------------------

READ_BOO_BOO						enum FatalErrors
	; Bytes read from stream were less than desired.

WRITE_BOO_BOO						enum FatalErrors
	; Bytes written to stream were less than desired.

CANNOT_CREATE_STREAM					enum FatalErrors
	; Either we tried to create a stream with a buffer that was
	; too big or we just plain don't have enough memory to 
	; allocate a stream.

STREAM_NOTIFIED_ERROR					enum FatalErrors
	; Error in the strea.  Check the registers to see the error 
	; code.  I don't know which register holds what values at this 
	; point.

STREAM_DRIVER_LIED_TO_US_ABOUT_AMOUNT_OF_DATA_IN_STREAM	enum FatalErrors
	; Read notification was sent with a different number of bytes of
	; data in the stream than there really is.

DIRECTORY_DOES_NOT_EXIST				enum FatalErrors
	; No such directory has been created yet or the path is wrong.

DIRECTORY_DOES_NOT_WANT_TO_EXIST			enum FatalErrors
	; Error creating the directory.  Check the pathname and the
	; error code in ax if you have an enquiring mind.

ERROR_LOADING_DRIVER					enum FatalErrors
	; Check ax for GeodeLoadError value to find out what went wrong.

FAILED_READ_BYTE_WHEN_THERE_IS_OBVIOUSLY_A_BYTE		enum FatalErrors
	; We checked the stream ahead of time to make sure that there
	; were bytes of data in there, but for some reason, the stream
	; says there aren't any bytes to be read now.  Pourquoi?

CANNOT_CLOSE_MESSAGE_FILE				enum FatalErrors
	; For some strange reason, we can't close the file. 
	; This shouldn't even be happening.  You must be having a nightmare.

;		ERROR CODES FOR THE STREAM
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------

;
;  Values for these errors continue from PagerDriverErrors which continue
;  from StreamErrors.  The reason is that no two of these errors can have
;  the same value since they will all be stored in the same place in the
;  streams and we want to be able to tell them apart.
