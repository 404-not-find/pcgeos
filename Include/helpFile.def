COMMENT @%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		Help file format
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

	Help files are created in GeoWrite, but saved in a special format.
In part, this is because the text needs to be accessed a page at a time,
rather than as a continuous stream.  It allows compressing the text more
easily for later decompression a page at a time.

	For a text object, there are a variety of data structures that
account for the text and the appearance of the text:
	1. text
	2. character runs
	3. character attributes
	4. paragraph runs
	5. paragraph attributes
	6. type runs
	7. type attributes
	8. graphic runs
	9. graphics
	10. names

	For a help file, the text is saved page by page, as are the
various runs.  There is only one copy of the various attribute structures,
as well as one copy of the names.  In addition, there is a single
compression dictionary used for all the text in the document.

	The text in the help file will be referenced by the names array --
each context name that refers to a page will have the DB group and item
of the associated help text stored with it.
