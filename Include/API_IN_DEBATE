 *	This file contains the filenames of any Include files that are in
 *	debate as to whether they should be part of the official API of GEOS.
 *
 *	NOTHING should be added or removed from any of the other API* files
 *	without first having gone through this file, & been reviewed by
 *	the API approval committee.
 *
 *      In general, proposed additions to the API will not be approved until:
 *
 *              - There are "C" equivalents (driver include files excluded)
 *              - There is one or more sample applications appropriate for
 *                distribution to developers demonstrating how to use the API.
 *              - All code is complete, fully tested, & ready to ship
 *                (including "C" stubs)
 *              - The API is stable & will not be a problem to maintain
 *                backwards compatibility with in the future
 *              - There is adequate documentation in the source code,
 *                and particularly in the include files
 *		- There is technical documentation on the API appropriate
 *		  for distribution to developers (this almost certainly
 *		  means docs created by the Tech Docs group)
 *
 * 	TO MAKE A CHANGE:  Add the filename & proposed changes to the top
 *	of the file below.  If you are proposing new API, be sure to refer
 *	to any specification files that may exist on the network.  Install
 *	this file, then send mail to "api-approval," asking that the
 *	proposal be reviewed.
 *
 *	Once you've received a decision, add an entry to the bottom of this
 *	file listing what the resolution was, the date, & perhaps most 
 *	importantly, the thinking behind the decision.  Then:
 *
 *	- Update API (API_DRIVER if needed)
 *	- Check the "C" equivalent file API_C (& API_DRIVER_C if equivalents
 *	  exist)

Don

net.def			PRIVATE					4/6/94
PRIVATE, to be PUBLIC for 2.1
Don
actually, I don't expect net.def to be part of 2.1. there will be a
socket.def, I believe, that *will* be part of 2.1, but net.def will be for the
net-library-that-does-everything-but-messaging-because-we-don't-have-time-to-
truly-abstract-other-network-functions-for-2.1 library
a

pcmcia.def		INTERNAL, DDK-only			4/6/94
Clearly, we want to allow developers to write PCMCIA drivers. The
interface for Zoomer is different from Bullet, and may change yet
again. So, we should document this, but allow ourselves to change the
interface in the future.
Don
I'd expect this to be part of the DDK, with the proviso that things work very
differently on the zoomer. if we hope to have pager card makers and things
like that to be able to develop drivers, this'll have to be documented and
made available.
a

fsd.def			INTERNAL, DDK-only			4/6/94
Moved to API_DDK.
Doug

wav.def			INTERNAL, Zoomer-only			4/6/94
This library was designed to be used only for the Zoomer. Once we've
completed the Sound Library extensions project, we will no longer
support this library, except to be used on Zoomer 1.0.  This is the
message we need to convey.
Don
There appear to be a few libraries that are meant for use *only* with
Zoomer.  I recommend that these be placed in yet another subdirectory
of "Include" and be marked clearly as Zoomer-only.  We will likely
end up with similar directories for other devices for some time...
(examples are InkFix, Wav, and Zoomer libraries).
Pete.


watchercom.def          NUKED					4/6/94
doesn't exist, even according to itself.
PeterD
This file is empty.  'watcher.def' has replaced it.
-john

watcher.def		PRIVATE					4/6/94
watcher.def should not be published
-john

shell.def, .uih		INTERNAL, though not yet documented	4/6/94
the shell library is useful for things doing file-manager-like stuff (e.g.
it has utility routines for creating CIF_FILES transfer items). It's
undocumented, though (it's used by all file managers, not just Wizard stuff)
a

import.def, .uih	NUKED (obsolete)			4/6/94
options.def, .uih	NUKED (obsolete)			4/6/94
Doug is right - obsolete. There are a bunch of .DEF files like this
that need to be nuked from Include. This will be done before 2.1 is
released.
-Don

deckMap.def		PRIVATE					4/6/94
if cards.def is private, this should be private too.

threed.def		PRIVATE					4/6/94
(threed.def, not thread.def)
Don

blib.def		PRIVATE					4/6/94
blib.uih		PRIVATE					4/6/94
definitely bullet private.
a

netware.def		PRIVATE					4/6/94
not really appropriate. it's just a reworking of the Netware API into Esp
structures and constants. it's not appropriately part of our API.
a

netmsg.def		PRIVATE					4/6/94
I would expect this to become socket.def, given that Eric W & co. renamed
everything to be SocketMumble instead of NetMsgMumble... it will be part of
2.1, when complete.

classifier.def		PRIVATE					4/6/94
emaillst.def		""
emailtmp.def		""
Do not publish these. They are all old .def files related to the email
project. 
-john

faxfile.def		PRIVATE					4/6/94
Do not publish this yet. The fax software is still in flux right now,
and this stuff is not stable (and has no C interface, etc...)

helpFile.def            PRIVATE					4/7/94
Causes more support pain than it gives in benefits
Peter

config.def		PUBLIC					4/7/94
It's used when creating preferences modules. has
that stuff been documented?
a
We have a Config chapter, and it's being released in the SDK docs. So
if it hinges upon that criteria, then feel free to include the code.
If you don't want to release it for some other reason, let me know so
we can remove reference to it...

Correct.
