This is a summary of all of the PC/GEOS include files and their function.  This
file covers both the Include/ directory (object assembly) and the Cinclude/
directory (C).

	PC/GEOS geodes.
.def	Object assembly include file
.h	C include file
.ui	UIC include file (soon to disappear)
.ldf	Library definition file (binary files created by glue)


.mk files (not checked for 2.0)
---------
appl.mk
driver.mk
geode.mk
geos.mk
gpath.mk
lib.mk
test.mk		Definitions for creating PC GEOS test files

Global .def and .h files
------------------------
	**** NOTE: .def files listed below have been updated for 2.0
	****       unless marked with a **
All .def files explicitly include other .def files that they need except for
geos.def, which is assumed to always be included.

================== QUESTIONS ==========================================
Segment, esp/glue interface issues:
* Need macro to decode protocol constants from command line args (DecodeXXX)
* GeodeGetResourceHandle, GeodeGetGeodeResourceHandle

Kernel areas not implemented:
* VMSetReloc not implemented (requires a bit somewhere saying that the callback
  is a C routine)
* Graphics string macros (gstring.h) not implemented
* text.h not implemented, GrDrawTextField not implemented
* How to call drivers from C ? (Most likely: one call that has a structure
  defining all the registers)
* Part of win.h is not implemented pending window system work by doug
* GeodeDispatchFromQueue (geode.h)

Areas not yet changed for 2.0 or for C:
* spool.def, spool.uih
* ui.def, generic.uih
* sound.def
* background.def
* grobj.def, grobj.uih
* import.def, import.uih
* cards.def, cards.uih
* deckMap.def
* vmdef.def

What support for SDK ???
* calendar.def
* rolodex.def

Other issues:
* How to deal with VM and DB overrides (currently the routines are not exported)
* ANSI library support
* Floating point support
* Support for writing DLL's (Establish_Dgroup, _loadds)

goc stuff to do:
* finish kbd path stuff
* gstring monikers
* chunks, hints and monikers with artitrary data (make a structure)
