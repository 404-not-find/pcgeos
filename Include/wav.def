global WavPlayFile:far
; Opens a file containing a .WAV sound, spawns a thread, and plays it in the
; background.
;
;PASS:		
;	bx - disk handle OR StandardPath
;		If BX is 0, then the passed path is either relative to
;		the thread's current path, or is absolute (with a
;		drive specifier).
;
;	ds:dx - Path specification.  The path MAY contain a drive
;		spec, in which case, BX should be passed in as zero.
;
;	es:di - file name with extension and null terminated
;Return:	nothing
;Destroyed:	nothing

global PlaySoundFromFile:far
; Plays a .WAV sound from the passed file handle
; Pass: bx - file han
; Return: nothing

global WavPlayInitSound:far
; Play a wav file specified under the [sound] category the .ini file.
;
; To call this function, you need to make sure the wav file is pointed by a key
; under [sound] category.  The key is composed of the GeodeToken of the calling
; app, and an enumerated word value defined by the app.  For example, the Tetris
; game plays a wav file for dropping pieces.  In tetris, the code calls this
; WavPlayInitSound with Tetris GeodeToken and a word value defined by Tetris.
;
;	#define TETRIS_DROP_SOUND   0
;	#define TETRIS_ROTATE_SOUND 1
;	GeodeToken token;
;	GeodeGetInfo(GeodeGetCodeProcessHandle(), GGIT_TOKEN_ID, &token);
;	WavPlayInitSound(&token, TETRIS_DROP_SOUND);
;	WavPlayInitSound(&token, TETRIS_ROTATE_SOUND);
;
; In the net.ini file, you specifed the wav file associate with the sound by:
;
;	[sound]
;	84_69_84_82_0_0 = drop.wav
;	84_69_84_82_0_1 = rotate.wav
;
; where "84_69_84_82" is the ascii decimal value of "TETR", the 4 letter token
; chars of the app, the second last digit is the manufacutre ID of Tetris.
; (MANUFACTURE_ID_GEOWORKS is 0.)  The last digit is the enumerated word value
; defined by the app.
;
;
; Pass: cx:dx = vfptr to GeodeToken
;	bx - enumerated type, defined by each app.
; Return: nothing
; Destroyed: nothing


global WavLockExclusive:far
; Lock the global exclusive.  Only one thread can play
; a wav file at a time.
; 		
; May be called externally to wait for a sound to finish
; playing.  (Be sure to UnlockExclusive as well).
; 
; PASS:		nothing
; RETURN:	nothing
; DESTROYED:	nothing
; SIDE EFFECTS:	
; 		May block if someone is playing a sound.

; Release global exclusive.
