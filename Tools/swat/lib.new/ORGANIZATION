
This directory contains the files that comprise SWAT's 80x8x instruction
reference guide. At this time, the reference guide is split across two
files:

ref.80x8x	Reference information for all instructions

timing.80x8x	Condensed timing information and valid addressing modes
		for all instructions. This information is placed in this
		file so that SWAT can access it quickly when compiling
		timing information for blocks of code
