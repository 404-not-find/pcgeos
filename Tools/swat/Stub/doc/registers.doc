When a thread blocks at the end of a time slice, the stack is formated as:

SS:SP->	bp
	es
	dx
	flags
	cx
	di
	si
	ds
	<near-ret-addr>
	bx
	ax
	<iret-addr>: ip
		     cs

SS and SP are saved in the thread handle.

When a thread blocks on a queue, ax and bx are trashed, but the rest of the
stack is the same.
