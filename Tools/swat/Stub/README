This directory contains the low-memory version of Swat's debugging
stub. Refer to the document "Swat's PC-Resident Stub" for more info on
the workings of this beast. Of course, you can also check the source.

Briefly, the files and what they contain are as follows:

    main.asm	    startup code and utility functions, e.g. SaveState and
    	    	    RestoreState
    kernel.asm	    interface to the kernel. Responsible for the
    	    	    reading and writing of memory, reporting of state
		    changes and generally intruding on the kernel's space
    cbreak.asm	    implements the fast conditional breakpoints provided
    	    	    by Swat
    rpc.asm 	    the communications subsystem, along with various of
    	    	    the services provided by the stub
    com.asm 	    the data-link layer, for you OSI fans. Interfaces to
    	    	    a com port
    kjump.asm	    silly jumptable thing to define all the kernel things
    	    	    extrn'ed by including files, but not add any code
		    to the stub.
