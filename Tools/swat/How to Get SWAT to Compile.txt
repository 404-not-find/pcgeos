HOW TO GET SWAT TO COMPILE

Lysle Shields 06/27/00

SWAT is made up of several pieces as listed below:

  File		Location
  ----		--------
  compat.lib	ROOT_DIR/Tools/vc++/compat
  lst.lib	ROOT_DIR/Tools/PMAKE/LIB/LST
  winutil.lib	ROOT_DIR/Tools/WINUTIL
  tcl.lib	ROOT_DIR/Tools/SWAT/TCL
  ntcurses.lib	ROOT_DIR/SWAT/NTCURSES
  swat.exe	ROOT_DIR/SWAT

In each of the above directories there are these files:

  XXX.MAK	Makefile to be used by NMAKE or PMAKE.BAT
  PMAKE.BAT	Script to force a full recompile of debug and 
		release versions
  XXX.DSP	Project file for DevStudio 6.0
  XXX.DSW	Workspace for DevStudio 6.0
  XXX.DEP	Dependency file used by VC++

The easiest way to compile the code is to run PMAKE.BAT for each of the 
.lib files in the top list.  Just make sure your environment variables 
have been setup by the installer for VC++ 6.0.  If not, there is some 
bat files called VCVARS32.BAT that can set them up on a per usage 
basis.

If you do not use the command line method, you can also load the .DSW 
file for each module and compile there.  The only problem is the 
include directories and library directories are not setup correctly on 
a machine to machine basis.  Setup your directories as follows under 
Tools -> Options -> Directories

	Include Files
	-------------------------------------------------------
	G:\perforce\pcgeos\Tools\INCLUDE
	G:\perforce\pcgeos\Tools\UTILS
	G:\perforce\pcgeos\Tools\vc++\include
	D:\Program Files\Visual Studio\VC98\INCLUDE
	D:\Program Files\Visual Studio\VC98\MFC\INCLUDE
	D:\Program Files\Visual Studio\VC98\ATL\INCLUDE
	C:\WINNT\Profiles\LShields\Desktop\%include%
	g:\perforce\pcgeos\Tools\pmake\lib\lst
	G:\perforce\pcgeos\Tools\PMAKE\SRC\LIB\INCLUDE
	g:\perforce\pcgeos\Tools\swat\tcl
	G:\perforce\pcgeos\Tools\SWAT\NTCURSES

	Library files
	-------------------------------------------------------
	D:\Program Files\Visual Studio\VC98\LIB
	D:\Program Files\Visual Studio\VC98\MFC\LIB
	C:\WINNT\Profiles\LShields\Desktop\%lib%
	G:\perforce\pcgeos\Tools\vc++\lib

Notice that the include file list puts many of our directories first.  
This helps avoid conflicting file names like file.h.  In the above, 
G:\Perforce\pcgeos\ is the same as $ROOT_DIR and D:\Program 
Files\Visual Studio\VC98 would be your VC++ 6.0 install directory.

Some more notes:  

 * All the library (.lib) files are compiled and stored in 
ROOT_DIR/Tools/vc++/lib (notice that this is not the Installed 
directory).

 * The Installed subdirectories are not used, so don't go looking for 
files there.  We may change that in the future.

 * There is both a Debug and Release version of all the lib's and 
SWAT.EXE.  Debug .lib files ar in ROOT_DIR/Tools/vc++/lib while RElease 
.lib files are in ROOT_DIR/Tools/vc++/lib/Release.  We most likely will 
only use the Debug version for internal use.
