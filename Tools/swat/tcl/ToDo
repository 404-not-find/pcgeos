This file contains a list of bugs that need to be fixed in the Tcl
system, plus features that should be added and issues that should
be considered:

2. Use semi-colon for command separators?

5. Change "var" to "set", eliminate one-arg option?

6. Suggestion from Adam: allow tracing AFTER command execution, so
tracer can get access to the result of the command.  Or, just pass
the command off to the tracer, and let it invoke the command procedure,
IF IT WISHES.

7. Also from Adam:  add a procedure Tcl_ReturnPrintf(interp, format, etc.)
to eliminate the need to handle a previously-set static value.
