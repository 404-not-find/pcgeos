  This Desk Accessories folder has been created to allow you to create a special class of applications called Desk Accessories.  To create a Desk Accessory, simply drag the application icon to this folder.  Once placed in this folder, the application will assume the special Desk Accessory behavior described below.  

Desk Accessory Behavior

1.  In Motif UI mode, Desk Accessories are listed in their own section in the Express menu between the list of running applications and the Start an Application menu selection.  They are placed here so that you will always have them at your fingertips.
    In ISUI mode, Desk Accessories are listed at the top of the Express menu.

2.  Desk Accessories always stay on top of other applications.  If you click on the window beneath them they will stay open and on top.

If for any reason you delete the Desk Accessories folder, you can recreate it by using the Create Folder command (located in the File menu of GeoManager in Motif mode, or in ISUI mode by right-clicking the mouse which will bring up the Create Folder menu item). Just name the new folder Desk Accessories. The Desk Accessories folder must be located/created in the World folder.
