Making a Demo of Ensemble 4.x

In Library\SpecUI\CommonUI\CMain turn on the WIN_DEMO switches in cmainUIDocumentControl.asm & .ui and compile motif and isui.  Copy the resulting geodes to tools\build\product\bbxensem\demo.

Make sure to go back and turn off the switches and recompile for your non-demo geodes.

I've done the above two manually since I cannot get the is_a_product stuff to work automagically.

*************************************
Build using the 'demo' flag.  The build file will select the demo version of isui and motif which turns off saving.  The build file will also select the demo versions of the splash screen, and assorted .txt files.
*************************************
And I can't get the build stuff to do a demo build either :-(   So, replace the corresponding pc build files with the ones in tools/.../demo

And since protobiffer needs all the geodes being biffed in a full up Geos tree copy the games stuff into the demo build and run ProtoBiffer

Put it all in the demo installer
